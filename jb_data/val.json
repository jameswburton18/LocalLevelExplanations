Both F6 and F10 have a high level of influence and in comparison, the remaining input features have minimal influence such as F9, F7, F2, and F5. Among the top level features, F10 has a strong negative contribution, decreasing the odds of the assigned label, while on the contrary, F6, F9, and F7 all direct the model to classify the given case as C3. F2 and F11 both have values that increase the prediction likelihood toward C3, but F5 and F12 are like F10, reducing the chance of the label C3. Finally, according to the analysis conducted, the features having the least influence are F3, F1, F4, and F8 since the model places minimal importance on their relative values when choosing the label for this instance.",

F2, F5, F9, and F4 have been shown to have a negative effect on the algorithm, basically encouraging the decision toward label C1 but their collective influence is out-ranked by that of the positive features F6, F7, F1, F8, and F3.",

F24 is the most influential feature with a negative contribution that significantly decreases the likelihood of label C2 being the correct label for the given case and it favours labelling the case as C1. The influence of the remaining features can be described as moderate to low and the notable moderately influential features are F20, F25, and F6, with positive contributions increasing the odds of label C2. However, F9, F12, F15, and F3 have identical direction of influence as F24, decreasing the likelihood of the assigned label. Per the attributions analysis, not all the features are shown to contribute to the classification above; those with basically no influence on the model's decision here include F23, F16, F1, and F13.",

        "narration": "Based on the fact that the prediction likelihood probability of the alternative label, C1, is only 2.29%, the most probable label for the given data instance is C2. All the relevant features have positive contributions, increasing the odds of C2 being the correct label. However, the classification decision here is not based on the values of features such as F17, F19, F13, and F30 since they have negligible contributions. Finally, among the relevant features considered by the model to arrive at the label assigned, F8, F2, F9, F28, F20, F5, and F29 are the most influential. Since no feature is shown to negatively contribute to the decision here, it is not surprising that C2 has a very high classification likelihood.",

Among the set of features considered here, only F6 and F4 are shifting the verdict away from C2 but are  pushing for C1, while the rest are referred to as positive features since their contributions increase the model's response in support of assigning the C1 label. Given the attributions from the negative features, it is not enough to shift the forecast in the direction of the other class since the joint positive influence of F8, F10, and F3 outweighs them.

The significant influence on the forecast decision above is the F8, F5, F4, and F3 values, the least important features are identified as F7, F10, and F14. Of the set of features employed for this classification, F1, F11, F12, and F14 are the ones that have values conflicting the C1 estimate and this is mainly because their values support labelling the case as C2. This means that the majority of the features have values that lead the model to predict C1 for the case under study and the most positive features are F3, F4, F5, F6, and F8, whereas, F7, F2, F13, and F10 have the least positive influence on the labelling judgement made by the model for this case. All in all, since the joint negative influence of F1, F11, F12, and F14 is dawrfed by the positive attributions of the remaining features, it is not surprising that to see such high confidence level associated with the model's output decision.",

Further analysis performed to understand the influence of each input feature shows that F9, F15, F16, F12, F5, F6, and F7 contribute negatively in support of assigning C2, which happens to be the least probable class. F10, F20, F19, F17, F2, and F11 are among the positive features that increase the odds and push the algorithm to label the given case as C1. Even though the most influential features, F9 and F15, have a negative impact, the algorithm is pretty sure that C1 is the most logical label for the given case; hence the positive features succeed in driving the decision higher in favour of the assigned label and away from C2.",

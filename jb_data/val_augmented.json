Both F3 and F7 have a high level of influence and in comparison, the remaining input features have minimal influence such as F1, F6, F9, and F8. Among the top level features, F7 has a strong negative contribution, decreasing the odds of the assigned label, while on the contrary, F3, F1, and F6 all direct the model to classify the given case as C3. F9 and F4 both have values that increase the prediction likelihood toward C3, but F8 and F12 are like F7, reducing the chance of the label C3. Finally, according to the analysis conducted, the features having the least influence are F10, F11, F2, and F5 since the model places minimal importance on their relative values when choosing the label for this instance.",

F3, F8, F5, and F1 have been shown to have a negative effect on the algorithm, basically encouraging the decision toward label C1 but their collective influence is out-ranked by that of the positive features F4, F7, F9, F6, and F2.",

The influence of the remaining features can be described as moderate to low and the notable moderately influential features are F16, F25, and F12, with positive contributions increasing the odds of label C1. However, F6, F30, F8, and F17 have identical direction of influence as F23, decreasing the likelihood of the assigned label. Per the attributions analysis, not all the features are shown to contribute to the classification above; those with basically no influence on the model's decision here include F2, F18, F10, and F20.",

        "narration": "Based on the fact that the prediction likelihood probability of the alternative label, C2, is only 2.29%, the most probable label for the given data instance is C1. All the relevant features have positive contributions, increasing the odds of C1 being the correct label. However, the classification decision here is not based on the values of features such as F30, F26, F1, and F2 since they have negligible contributions. Finally, among the relevant features considered by the model to arrive at the label assigned, F5, F15, F20, F18, F23, F14, and F11 are the most influential. Since no feature is shown to negatively contribute to the decision here, it is not surprising that C1 has a very high classification likelihood.",

Among the set of features considered here, only F2 and F9 are shifting the verdict away from C2 but are  pushing for C1, while the rest are referred to as positive features since their contributions increase the model's response in support of assigning the C1 label. Given the attributions from the negative features, it is not enough to shift the forecast in the direction of the other class since the joint positive influence of F4, F8, and F10 outweighs them.

Of the set of features employed for this classification, F10, F12, F3, and F1 are the ones that have values conflicting the C2 estimate and this is mainly because their values support labelling the case as C1. This means that the majority of the features have values that lead the model to predict C2 for the case under study and the most positive features are F13, F11, F2, F8, and F14, whereas, F4, F6, F9, and F5 have the least positive influence on the labelling judgement made by the model for this case. All in all, since the joint negative influence of F10, F12, F3, and F1 is dawrfed by the positive attributions of the remaining features, it is not surprising that to see such high confidence level associated with the model's output decision.",

Further analysis performed to understand the influence of each input feature shows that F4, F16, F19, F10, F14, F9, and F15 contribute negatively in support of assigning C1, which happens to be the least probable class. F8, F3, F7, F5, F6, and F12 are among the positive features that increase the odds and push the algorithm to label the given case as C2. Even though the most influential features, F4 and F16, have a negative impact, the algorithm is pretty sure that C2 is the most logical label for the given case; hence the positive features succeed in driving the decision higher in favour of the assigned label and away from C1.",

F9 and F1 both have values that increase the prediction likelihood toward C3, but F5 and F2 are like F12, reducing the chance of the label C3.

Per the attributions of the moderately influential features, F13 and F12 are shifting the classification away from C1. However, F1, F3, F5, and F2 have a positive influence in support of C1. Also, the very small decrease in the likelihood of C1 can be blamed on the negative influence of F10 and F15. By just considering the fact that the top features F4, F14, F9, and F7 are psuhing the decision higher towards the C1, it is not surprising to see such a high confidence level as represented by 99.92% and 0.08%, respectively, for the C1 and C2 labels.",

Amongst them F15 and F12 have a negative impact among these relevant features, reducing the chance of C2 being the label for the current scenario. In addition, F8, F23, and F21 have a moderate positive impact on the model's choice, while F14 has a negative effect on the model, shifting the prediction in a different direction.

All the remaining features, such as F20, and F35, have negligible influence on the decision, hence they can be considered irrelevant to arriving at the abovementioned classification output. The top features with considerable positive attributions resulting in the classification verdict above are F40 and F25. Besides, all the remaining features have moderate or negligible contributions to the prediction made here and there are some features, such as F2, F12, F19, and F21, that are shifting the verdict away from C1 towards C3.",

Of the set of features employed for this classification, F9, F3, F12, and F13 are the ones that have values conflicting the C1 estimate and this is mainly because their values support labelling the case as C2. This means that the majority of the features have values that lead the model to predict C1 for the case under study and the most positive features are F6, F14, F11, F1, and F2, whereas, F10, F8, F4, and F7 have the least positive influence on the labelling judgement made by the model for this case. All in all, since the joint negative influence of F9, F3, F12, and F13 is dawrfed by the positive attributions of the remaining features, it is not surprising that to see such high confidence level associated with the model's output decision.",

F4 has a positive attribution while F2 and F3 have negative values, dragging the prediction in favour of C2.

Among the relevant features, F10, F9, F84, F89, F4, and F49 were shown as the only positive features that increased the model response in favour of the chosen class, C1.

Finally, according to the analysis, F3, F13, F1, and F10 all have very small impacts on the final prediction.

F8 is the primary motivator behind the above labelling decision and also F9, F5, F4, F2, F3, and F7 are somewhat influential features, however, F1 and F6 have a very low but non-negligible impact. The algorithm's confidence in this classification can be explained by considering the direction of effect of the input features. The majority of the features are considered positives, boosting or improving the likelihood that C2 is the correct label for example the influential features, F8, F5, and F4, has a positive attribution in favour of labelling the case as C2. F9, F2, F1, and F6 have been shown to have a negative effect on the algorithm, basically encouraging the decision toward label C1 but their collective influence is out-ranked by that of the positive features F8, F5, F7, F3, and F4.",

This indicates that the majority of features have values that drive the model towards estimating C1 for the case under consideration, so it is understandable why the model is very confident about the assigned label.

Among the set of features considered here, only F1 and F7 are shifting the verdict away from C2 but are  pushing for C1, while the rest are referred to as positive features since their contributions increase the model's response in support of assigning the C1 label. Given the attributions from the negative features, it is not enough to shift the forecast in the direction of the other class since the joint positive influence of F11, F10, and F4 outweighs them.

The other features with a positive influence are F11, F8, and F9. In contrast, the value of F10 has a negative contribution to this prediction decision and hence can be considered as part of the reason why the model says there is a slim chance the true label could be C2.

The variables with negative contributions that decrease the likelihood of the assigned label are F3, F5, F2, and F4. Conversely, F9, F6, F8, F7, F1, and F10 have positive contributions that drive the model's response higher in favour of label C1.

The majority of the features are considered positives, boosting or improving the likelihood that C1 is the correct label for example the influential features, F8, F4, and F7, has a positive attribution in favour of labelling the case as C1. F9, F1, F6, and F5 have been shown to have a negative effect on the algorithm, basically encouraging the decision toward label C2 but their collective influence is out-ranked by that of the positive features F8, F4, F3, F2, and F7.",

Of the set of features employed for this classification, F4, F9, F14, and F5 are the ones that have values conflicting the C2 estimate and this is mainly because their values support labelling the case as C1.

All in all, since the joint negative influence of F4, F9, F14, and F5 is dawrfed by the positive attributions of the remaining features, it is not surprising that to see such high confidence level associated with the model's output decision.",

Per the attributions of the moderately influential features, F6 and F12 are shifting the classification away from C2. However, F7, F2, F8, and F9 have a positive influence in support of C2. Also, the very small decrease in the likelihood of C2 can be blamed on the negative influence of F1 and F3. By just considering the fact that the top features F10, F4, F14, and F15 are psuhing the decision higher towards the C2, it is not surprising to see such a high confidence level as represented by 99.92% and 0.08%, respectively, for the C2 and C1 labels.",

According to the above information, the most likely class is C1. Hence, it is the class chosen by the model with a very high level of confidence. However, the values of about 20 attributes were considered relevant, and the rest were considered irrelevant to the classification of a particular case. These less important features include F66, F24, F51, and F86. F35, F36, F76, F22, and F73 are the key features contributing to the prediction evaluation above. Among the relevant features, F76, F56, F71, F55, F80, and F39 were shown as the only positive features that increased the model response in favour of the chosen class, C1. Conversely, the remaining relevant features made negative contributions, reducing the likelihood of outputting C1. These passive features include F35, F36, F22, and F73.",

F11, F3, and F12 are the top-ranked positively contributing features supporting the C1 prediction, whereas F17 has a negative contribution that pushes the final prediction away. In addition, F14, F4, and F18 contribute positively towards the classification here, whereas F9, F19, and F2 contribute negatively, hence encouraging the prediction of C2. Finally, according to the analysis, F7, F5, F16, and F15 all have very small impacts on the final prediction. To sum up, given that F11 and F3 have higher contributions than the top negative feature, F17, it is not surprising that the model is certain that C1 is the most probable label for this case.",

Considering the direction of influence of the input features, F1, F13, F7, and F5 are the only features to have negative contributions towards the C2 since their contributions rather support labelling the case as C1. This indicates that the majority of features have values that drive the model towards estimating C2 for the case under consideration, so it is understandable why the model is very confident about the assigned label. F2, F14, F12, and F8 are the most relevant positive features, but on the lower end, F10, F5, and F4 have little effect on the decision made by the model for this case.",

This means that the majority of the features have values that lead the model to predict C1 for the case under study and the most positive features are F14, F12, F11, F8, and F2, whereas, F13, F6, F1, and F9 have the least positive influence on the labelling judgement made by the model for this case. All in all, since the joint negative influence of F5, F4, F7, and F3 is dawrfed by the positive attributions of the remaining features, it is not surprising that to see such high confidence level associated with the model's output decision.",

In a nutshell, the very high confidence in the classification can be justified by the fact that only F2 and F3 are shown to have negative contributions to the decision, and the collective influence of the identified negative features is small when compared to that of F4, F1, and F5.",

Both F11 and F2 have a high level of influence and in comparison, the remaining input features have minimal influence such as F6, F7, F10, and F1. Among the top level features, F2 has a strong negative contribution, decreasing the odds of the assigned label, while on the contrary, F11, F6, and F7 all direct the model to classify the given case as C3. F10 and F8 both have values that increase the prediction likelihood toward C3, but F1 and F3 are like F2, reducing the chance of the label C3. Finally, according to the analysis conducted, the features having the least influence are F5, F9, F12, and F4 since the model places minimal importance on their relative values when choosing the label for this instance.",

F3, F4, F1, and F6 have been shown to have a negative effect on the algorithm, basically encouraging the decision toward label C2 but their collective influence is out-ranked by that of the positive features F7, F5, F9, F2, and F8.",

Per the attributions analysis, not all the features are shown to contribute to the classification above; those with basically no influence on the model's decision here include F27, F17, F2, and F13.",

However, the classification decision here is not based on the values of features such as F16, F24, F17, and F18 since they have negligible contributions. Finally, among the relevant features considered by the model to arrive at the label assigned, F14, F23, F8, F10, F3, F25, and F15 are the most influential. Since no feature is shown to negatively contribute to the decision here, it is not surprising that C2 has a very high classification likelihood.",

Among the set of features considered here, only F7 and F4 are shifting the verdict away from C2 but are  pushing for C1, while the rest are referred to as positive features since their contributions increase the model's response in support of assigning the C1 label. Given the attributions from the negative features, it is not enough to shift the forecast in the direction of the other class since the joint positive influence of F10, F11, and F9 outweighs them.

Of the set of features employed for this classification, F4, F8, F13, and F2 are the ones that have values conflicting the C2 estimate and this is mainly because their values support labelling the case as C1. This means that the majority of the features have values that lead the model to predict C2 for the case under study and the most positive features are F7, F5, F11, F9, and F10, whereas, F3, F14, F12, and F6 have the least positive influence on the labelling judgement made by the model for this case. All in all, since the joint negative influence of F4, F8, F13, and F2 is dawrfed by the positive attributions of the remaining features, it is not surprising that to see such high confidence level associated with the model's output decision.",

Further analysis performed to understand the influence of each input feature shows that F8, F15, F21, F5, F9, F22, and F12 contribute negatively in support of assigning C1, which happens to be the least probable class. F7, F14, F10, F1, F16, and F19 are among the positive features that increase the odds and push the algorithm to label the given case as C2. Even though the most influential features, F8 and F15, have a negative impact, the algorithm is pretty sure that C2 is the most logical label for the given case; hence the positive features succeed in driving the decision higher in favour of the assigned label and away from C1.",

Per the attributions of the moderately influential features, F5 and F7 are shifting the classification away from C2. However, F10, F15, F8, and F11 have a positive influence in support of C2. Also, the very small decrease in the likelihood of C2 can be blamed on the negative influence of F4 and F3. By just considering the fact that the top features F14, F6, F13, and F1 are psuhing the decision higher towards the C2, it is not surprising to see such a high confidence level as represented by 99.92% and 0.08%, respectively, for the C2 and C1 labels.",

According to the analysis, the most relevant features examined during the label assignment are F3, F14, F22, and F30. Amongst them F30 and F3 have a negative impact among these relevant features, reducing the chance of C1 being the label for the current scenario. In addition, F5, F6, and F24 have a moderate positive impact on the model's choice, while F18 has a negative effect on the model, shifting the prediction in a different direction.

All the remaining features, such as F16, and F8, have negligible influence on the decision, hence they can be considered irrelevant to arriving at the abovementioned classification output. The top features with considerable positive attributions resulting in the classification verdict above are F44 and F22. Besides, all the remaining features have moderate or negligible contributions to the prediction made here and there are some features, such as F6, F35, F46, and F29, that are shifting the verdict away from C1 towards C2.",

Of the set of features employed for this classification, F4, F14, F7, and F8 are the ones that have values conflicting the C2 estimate and this is mainly because their values support labelling the case as C1. This means that the majority of the features have values that lead the model to predict C2 for the case under study and the most positive features are F13, F10, F3, F2, and F5, whereas, F1, F9, F6, and F12 have the least positive influence on the labelling judgement made by the model for this case. All in all, since the joint negative influence of F4, F14, F7, and F8 is dawrfed by the positive attributions of the remaining features, it is not surprising that to see such high confidence level associated with the model's output decision.",

F4 has a positive attribution while F8 and F6 have negative values, dragging the prediction in favour of C2.

Among the relevant features, F15, F80, F60, F9, F72, and F26 were shown as the only positive features that increased the model response in favour of the chosen class, C1.

Finally, according to the analysis, F13, F6, F1, and F5 all have very small impacts on the final prediction.

F7 is the primary motivator behind the above labelling decision and also F2, F5, F6, F9, F3, and F8 are somewhat influential features, however, F1 and F4 have a very low but non-negligible impact. The algorithm's confidence in this classification can be explained by considering the direction of effect of the input features. The majority of the features are considered positives, boosting or improving the likelihood that C2 is the correct label for example the influential features, F7, F5, and F6, has a positive attribution in favour of labelling the case as C2. F2, F9, F1, and F4 have been shown to have a negative effect on the algorithm, basically encouraging the decision toward label C1 but their collective influence is out-ranked by that of the positive features F7, F5, F8, F3, and F6.",

This indicates that the majority of features have values that drive the model towards estimating C2 for the case under consideration, so it is understandable why the model is very confident about the assigned label.

Given the attributions from the negative features, it is not enough to shift the forecast in the direction of the other class since the joint positive influence of F9, F10, and F2 outweighs them.

In contrast, the value of F3 has a negative contribution to this prediction decision and hence can be considered as part of the reason why the model says there is a slim chance the true label could be C2.

In addition, F16, F11, and F12 have a moderate positive impact on the model's choice, while F5 has a negative effect on the model, shifting the prediction in a different direction.

The variables with negative contributions that decrease the likelihood of the assigned label are F3, F7, F1, and F4. Conversely, F9, F6, F2, F8, F10, and F5 have positive contributions that drive the model's response higher in favour of label C1.

The majority of the features are considered positives, boosting or improving the likelihood that C1 is the correct label for example the influential features, F2, F5, and F8, has a positive attribution in favour of labelling the case as C1. F4, F3, F7, and F6 have been shown to have a negative effect on the algorithm, basically encouraging the decision toward label C2 but their collective influence is out-ranked by that of the positive features F2, F5, F1, F9, and F8.",

There are only four features with values that contradict the direction of the model's decision, and they are F1, F3, F12, and F4. Among all the features, the features with marginally low contributions to the prediction include F12, F10, F4, and F11.

Of the set of features employed for this classification, F2, F8, F13, and F3 are the ones that have values conflicting the C2 estimate and this is mainly because their values support labelling the case as C1.

All in all, since the joint negative influence of F2, F8, F13, and F3 is dawrfed by the positive attributions of the remaining features, it is not surprising that to see such high confidence level associated with the model's output decision.",

Also, the very small decrease in the likelihood of C1 can be blamed on the negative influence of F9 and F2. By just considering the fact that the top features F6, F13, F4, and F15 are psuhing the decision higher towards the C1, it is not surprising to see such a high confidence level as represented by 99.92% and 0.08%, respectively, for the C1 and C2 labels.",

According to the above information, the most likely class is C2. Hence, it is the class chosen by the model with a very high level of confidence. However, the values of about 20 attributes were considered relevant, and the rest were considered irrelevant to the classification of a particular case. These less important features include F12, F16, F48, and F23. F89, F78, F81, F46, and F62 are the key features contributing to the prediction evaluation above. Among the relevant features, F81, F5, F31, F25, F9, and F37 were shown as the only positive features that increased the model response in favour of the chosen class, C2. Conversely, the remaining relevant features made negative contributions, reducing the likelihood of outputting C2. These passive features include F89, F78, F46, and F62.",

The algorithm's confidence in this classification can be explained by considering the direction of effect of the input features. The majority of the features are considered positives, boosting or improving the likelihood that C2 is the correct label for example the influential features, F5, F4, and F7, has a positive attribution in favour of labelling the case as C2. F8, F9, F3, and F1 have been shown to have a negative effect on the algorithm, basically encouraging the decision toward label C1 but their collective influence is out-ranked by that of the positive features F5, F4, F2, F6, and F7.",

This indicates that the majority of features have values that drive the model towards estimating C2 for the case under consideration, so it is understandable why the model is very confident about the assigned label. F8, F5, F6, and F14 are the most relevant positive features, but on the lower end, F4, F12, and F13 have little effect on the decision made by the model for this case.",

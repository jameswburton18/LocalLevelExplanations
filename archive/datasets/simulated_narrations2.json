Specifically, while the features F5, F6, F3, F8, F4, and F2 are shown to have contributed to the decision, F1 and F7 are deemed irrelevant by the model. For the relevant features, F6, F3, F2, and F4 contributions suggest that C1 is likely not the true label, which explains why the predicted probability of C1 is only 53.2%. Conversely, the motivation to label the given case as C1 is mainly due to the positive contributions of F5 and F8 pushing the classification higher away from the alternative labels, C3 and C2."

From the attribution investigation performed, the values of F3, F4, F7, and F9 have moderate contributions. The investigation also identified that the values of F1 and F11 are likely irrelevant, and hence have insignificant contribution to the algorithm's verdict with respect to the given case. Furthermore, while the values of F14, F2, F9, F17, and F10 are shown to positively improve the odds in favour of the C2 class, the values of features such as F8, F16, F13, F3, and F4 reduce the probability of the true label being C2. Together with other features F7, F12, F6, F5, and F15, the contributions of these negatives could explain why the predicted probability of C2 is only 61.39% while those of the remaining labels, C1 and C3, respectively, are 33.91% and 4.69%."

With a chance of around 16.31 percent, C3 is the next likely label. In contrast, the classifier is certain that neither C2 nor C1 is the true label and the aforesaid prediction output decision is primarily dependent on the variables or features presented to the classification algorithm. Conducting the attribution examination showed that the values of F13, F11, F2, and F7 have basically nothing to do with the decision to assign C4 to the given case. Conversely, the major contributors to the decision are the values of features such as F12, F15, F16, F3, and F14. The other notable contributors include F8, F10, F18, F6, and F4, whereas F5, F9, F17, and F1 are the least ranked among the influential features. Examining the feature attributions also indicated that the values of F12, F18, F9, and F17 can be blamed for the reduction in the odds of C4 being the true label since they contribute negatively contradicting the algorithm's choice. However, the push towards labelling the case as C4 is due to the positive contributions of features such as F15, F3, F14, F16, and F8."

Furthermore, the C3 and C4 labels have probabilities of 13.26% and 16.57%, respectively. The label choice is mainly due to the values of F20, F7, F24, F8, F2, and F33 since the attribution analysis identified them as the most influential variables considered by the model. According to the attributions assessment, the variables responsible for the reduction in the probability of the C2 label are mainly F20, F7, F8, F43, F30, and F1. The other negative variables include F21, F36, F37, F22, F38, and F28. What the negative variables suggest is that C1 or C4 or C4 could likely be the true label. However, this push towards the alternative labels is contradicted by the positive variables such as F24, F2, F33, F32, F11, and F15, resulting in the C2 assignment. F29, F42, F5, F9, F19, and F12 are some of the remaining variables with positive attributions pushing the decision in favour of the C2 label."

However, the values of features such as F40, and F16 have very little role in the label selection. From the attributions assessment, the features F20, F7, F8, F43, F30, F1, and F21 are marked as the negative variables since their contributions to the classification only lend themselves to pushing or steering the classification towards the alternative labels. Contradicting this negative influence on the algorithm are the top positive variables F24, F2, F33, and F32.

Per the attribution assessment, the values of F15, F2, F3, F14, F16, and F9 are the main negative contributors, pulling the decision in a totally different direction than the assigned label. Together with other nagatives, F4, F11, F17, and F19, they support labelling the case with a different label. Contradicting the negative contributions and pushing the narrative in favour of the C4, the positive features F8, F6, F7, F5, F1, F10, F12, F13, and F18. The competition between the negatives and positives explains why the predicted probability of C4 is only 56.15% while those of C1, C2, and C3, respectively, are 20.99%, 9.42%, and 13.44%."

Based on the predicted probabilities, it can be concluded that C1 and C2 have very little chance of being the true labels, whereas the likelihood of C3 is only 25.54%, making it the next probable label. The model's decision is heavily influenced by the values of F2, F7, F5, F18, and F11. But the values of F20, F21, and F17 are likely ignored by the model when deciding which label is most appropriate for the given case simply because they have attributions very close to zero. Pushing the model towards the alternative classes are the features F11, F9, F10, F8, F13, F16, and F19 with their negative contributions. In essence, the 63.11% confidence level in the decision is due to the strong positive influence of F2, F7, F5, and F18 while the remaining positive features are F3, F4, F6, F1, F15, F14, and F12."

F11, F9, F10, F1, F18, F12, F17, F15, and F3, on the other hand, are the negative features that push the classification verdict in a different direction.

From the predicted likelihoods of the classes, C3 was chosen as the most likely one. Confidence in the algorithm's label choice is attributed to the varying degrees of input feature contributions. The feature attribution analysis performed indicates that the values of F6 and F3 are probably not taken into consideration in the decision making here. Conversely, the influential features can be ranked as follows: F12, F11, F2, F9, F8, F1, F13, F7, F5, F10, F4, F14. The predicted probability of C3 is only 64.26% due to the negative contributions of F8, F1, F7, F5, F4, and F14, since these features' attributions steer the verdict away from the C3 label. Positive features F12, F11, F2, F9, F13, and F10 push the prediction closer to the C3 label. On account of the fact that the top features F12, F11, F2, and F9 are all positive, it is not surprising that C3 has a fairly high predicted probability."

As a consequence, C4 is the most plausible classification in this instance and to make this prediction decision, the values of all the features or variables were taken into account. From the feature attributions examination conducted, F6, F10, F2, F3, and F7 are the features with the most influence on the decision. Furthermore, the moderately influential features are F14, F12, F8, F1, and F11. Finally, F17, F15, F5, F13, F9, F16, and F4 are the remaining features ordered based on their impact level on the classification. Among the features, F6, F10, F2, F12, F8, F16, F13, and F9 are shown to be the positive features that push the prediction verdict in favour of the C4 label and away from the alternative labels. Reducing the likelihood of the C4 label and advocating for the selection of a different label are the negative labels F3, F7, F14, F1, F11, F15, F17, F5, and F4."

Furthermore, the predicted likelihoods of the alternative classes C3, C1, and C2 are 3.67%, 2.21%, and 17.35%, respectively, which implies that the model is certain that the likelihood of any of these labels is much smaller than that of C4. Examining the input variables indicates that the variables playing significant roles in this classification decision are F45, F1, F13, F23, and F41. The other variables with moderate contributions are F20, F19, F32, F30, and F28. Finally, the examination concluded that the remaining features, such as F17, F12, F18, F8, and F15, have lower contributions to the decision. With respect to the direction of influence of all the variables mentioned above, F13, F41, F28, F16, and F8 are the ones with negative attributions, resulting in a decrease in the likelihood of the C4 label. Specifically, the negative variables support labelling the case as either of the other possible labels, possibly C2. Contradicting the influence of the negative variables are the positive ones such as F45, F1, F23, and F20 that push the classification higher towards outputting the C4 label. In other words, the positive variables encourage the model to label the case as C4 instead of the other possible labels."

It can be concluded that, given the likelihood of C3 and C2, the model is certain that none of them is the true label. Furthermore, the likelihood of C1 is far less than that of C4. Therefore, the classification output decision is that C4 is the most likely label, with a predicted probability of 69.11%. Motivating this classification decision are the variables such as F8, F16, F10, F6, F7, F5, and F15. Investigating the contributions of the input variables with respect to this classification showed that F8, F15, F13, F22, F29, and F14 are the top negatives, causing the uncertainty in the prediction. These negatives support assigning a different label to the case given while on the other side of the coin, the prediction is supported by the values of the top positive variables, F16, F10, F6, F7, F5, F11, F4, and F17. The positive variables are responsible for the model's being certain that the true label is likely C4."

This C4 predicted probability is far greater than the other possible labels, hence we can conclude that the model is very certain that neither C1 nor C2 nor C3 is the true label. The features shown to play a major role in the class assignment decision above are F23, F44, F3, F39, F27, F45, and F13. Some of the other notable contributing features are F21, F16, F4, F37, F36, and F8. Among all the features mentioned here, F3, F27, F16, F4, F37, and F8 are the ones shown to have negative contributions, meaning they support assigning one of the other possible labels. Contradicting the negative influence is the very high joint positive contributions of F23, F44, F39, F45, F13, and F21. Taking into account or consideration the contributions of the positive features, the model is highly motivated to label the case as C4 and they are the ones that push the decision away from the other labels."

Because the predicted probability for C4 is significantly bigger than the estimated probabilities for the other three labels, we can conclude that the model is extremely positive that neither C1 nor C2 nor C3 is the true label. F23, F39, F27, F44, F13, F45, and F3 are the variables demonstrated to have a significant impact on the class assignment choice above. F21, F16, F4, F37, F36, and F8 are some of the other major contributing variables. Among all the variables described above, F3, F27, F16, F4, F37, and F8 have negative contributions, indicating that they favour selecting one of the other alternative labels. The very large combined positive contributions of F23, F44, F39, F45, F13, and F21 contradict the negative influence. In closing, the model's decision to classify the instance as C4 is motivated by the positive variables, and these are the ones that drive the conclusion away from the other labels."

The certainty of the model can be traced to the influence of the information supplied about the case. Specifically, regarding this case under consideration, the model's decision concerning the right label choice is primarily affected by the values of F17, F44, F14, F37, F41, F20, and F22. And among these features, F37, F22, F20, and F41 are the top negative features that attempt to drive the classification towards one of the other labels. However, considering the certainty of the classification decision here, it can be concluded that the influence of these aforementioned negative features together with other negatives such as F33, F3, and F27 is very small when compared to that of the top positive features, F17, F44, F14, and F19. Some of the other features with positive attributions are F28, F25, and F11."

With a confidence level of 81.28%, the algorithm outputs C4 as the most probable label choice. The influence of the various input variables analysed is responsible for the degree of certainty in the above prediction. Per the attribution examination, the most influential variables are F27, F8, F35, F20, F4, F24, and F29. Among the above-stated variables, F27, F4, F24, and F29 are the ones with positive attributions that drive the decision higher towards C4. Moderately influential positive variables are F46, F33, and F13. Given that the predicted confidence in the label choice is 81.28%, it can be concluded that the variables such as F8, F35, F20, F34, F39, and F49 with their negative attributions are responsible for the predicted likelihood across the alternative labels. In other words, the negative variables do not support labelling the case as C4, however, comparing the attributions of F8 and F35 to that of F27 explains why the model is highly certain that C4 is the most probable label."

The next probable class label is identified as C3, with a predicted likelihood of 13.43%. Finally, the likelihoods of C2 and C1 were 3.47% and 2.93%, respectively. Examining the attributions of the input variables indicates that F18, F22, F32, F7, F24, and F34 have the most influence on the classification output decision or verdict with respect to the given case. In addition, the values of F21, F3, F5, F33, F4, F46, and F38 are shown to moderately contribute to the decision made here. Among all the influential variables mentioned above, only F22, F24, F38, F4, and F46 are identified as negatives, suggesting that their contributions are responsible for the predicted likelihoods across the less probable labels C2, C1, and C3. In other words, the negative contributions of these variables support labelling the case as either C1 or C2 or C3. Contrary to their negative influence, the values of F18, F32, F7, F34, F21, and F3 strongly motivate the classification decision to head towards C4 and away from the other labels. The negative and positive contributions of the variables explain why the certainty in the decision is only 70.19%."

Considering the predicted probabilities across the labels, the influence of top negative variables F20, F3, F9, F21, and F17 is responsible for the marginal doubt in the final decision since their values motivate labelling the case as one of the other possible labels."

F1, F31, F29, and F12 are by far the most influential, whereas F3, F32, and F17 are among the least influential. Regarding the direction of influence of the features, F31, F29, F12, F14, and F24 are the top positive features, shifting the classification decision higher towards C4. Conversely, the contributions of F1, F7, F16, F5, F27, and F15 indicate that the true label could likely be one of the other labels. The very high confidence level of 92.05% can be easily explained by considering the fact that the majority of top contributing features have positive contributions that strongly drive the decision away from the other labels and towards the C4 label. Finally, the attributions analysis indicates that the values of F18, F11, and F10 have insignificant contributions to the final decision."

However, looking at the predicted probabilities across the other possible labels, it is clear why the classifier is quite certain that not all the labels are the right ones, and they are those with the least confidence. The top positive features that increase the classifier's response in favour of C4 are F23, F3, F1, and F16. Conversely, those with negative attributions that decrease the likelihood of C4 being the true label for the case under consideration are mainly F21, F4, F6, and F8, which are responsible for the apparent doubt in the classification output verdict. Given that several of the top influential features have positive attributions, it is not surprising that the output label of the classifier is C4 instead of another. Besides, F32, F12, F17, and F2 have moderate positive contributions, further shifting the decision towards C4. Finally, the classifier likely pays nearly no attention to the values of F10, F7, and F22 since their attributions, according to the analysis, are almost zero."

Examining the feature attributions showed that F6, F1, F20, F22, and F5 are the main contributors to the classification decision made for the case here. Furthermore, the analysis categorised the features into three main groups based on their respective directions of contribution. The positive features are mainly F20, F22, F2, F14, F11, and F8 with contributions increasing the likelihood of the assigned label. Driving the classification in a different direction are the negative features such as F6, F1, F5, F24, and F9, since their contributions decrease the odds of C4 being the true label. Finally, the irrelevant set of features, F13, F12, and F21, whose values are likely ignored by the classifier because their attribution scores are very close to zero, are the least ranked features. Given that the top features, F1 and F6, are all negative, it is not surprising that the algorithm is not 100.0% certain about the assigned label."

In addition, the likelihood of the assigned label is only 63.15%, and the features responsible for this decrease in the likelihood of C3 are the negative features such as F15, F9, F20, F37, and F5, since their contributions support a different label. F24, F10, F28, F13, and F16 are on the other hand, the top positive features that strongly drive the decision in favour of the C3 label."

In addition, the positive features are F13, F16, F8, and F15, further supporting the assignment of C3. On the contrary, shifting the prediction decision strongly in favour of one of the alternative labels is the top negative features, F4, F11, F6, F14, and F17.

The high positive attributions of F41, F39, F21, F32, and F34 improve the odds in favour of label C3, hence they push the classification decision away from the other labels. Swinging the decision in a different direction towards one of the other labels, C1, C4, and C4, are the negative features such as F14, F28, F5, F7, F9, and F43. These features, along with other negatives like F23, F16, and F12, explain why predicted probabilities of C1, C4, and C2 are greater than 0.0%. Finally, F3, F25, and F19 are also positive features, driving the decision further higher towards C3."

Inspection of the contributions of the variables indicated that the contributions of F16, F11, F9, F10, F17, and F5 are higher than all the other variables. Those with moderate contributions are F19, F20, F12, F7, and F25. Among all the above-mentioned variables, F16, F11, F12, F7, and F25 are the main positive ones, increasing the odds in favour of C3. Reducing the likelihood of the C3 label in favour of a different label are the contributions of F9, F10, F17, F5, F19, and F20, which explain the probability distribution across the alternative labels. Finally, the contributions of F29, F8, F3, and F1 are irrelevant to the algorithm's decision with regard to the given case since their attributions are very close to zero."

According to the direction of influence of the features, we can conclude that the strong positive influence of F20, F10, F16, F25, and F26 is far greater than the joint negative influence of F23, F15, F11, F14, and F21, which explains why the algorithm is relatively certain that neither C2 nor C4 nor C1 is the true label for the given case. Finally, the attribution analysis also showed that F3, F1, F5, and F29 have almost nothing to do with the decision made regarding this case under consideration."

The alternative labels, C2, C1, and C4, have their respective predicted likelihoods equal to 19.73%, 15.67%, and 1.18%. Considering the above-mentioned predicted likelihood, it is valid to conclude that the chances of C4 being the true label are very low compared to the others. The predicted likelihoods across classes are the result of the top variables F18, F6, F8, F14, F16, and F13's influences and contributions. The variables with moderate contributions are F10, F5, F2, F11, and F15, and finally, those identified as irrelevant to the decision are F3 and F4. Increasing the odds in favour of C3 are the positive contributions from F6, F8, F14, F16, F10, and F2, whereas, the contributions of F18, F13, F5, F11, and F15 contradict and support the assignment of an alternative label. In simple terms, the negative influence of the negative features is the main reason for doubt in the classification decision made by the model."

The classification confidence is moderate considering the fact that it is only marginally greater than average. For this decision, the variables considered most by the model are F18, 18, F31, F32, F40, F41, and F43, while F39, F21, F37, and F23 are the least important. Among these top variables, the direction of influence of F20 and F41 suggests that they are negative variables, contradicting the decision made by the model and consequently reducing the probability of C3. Some of the other negative variables are F33, F16, F5, and F35. Countering the negative attributions and pushing the decision higher in favour of C3 are the positive variables F18, F31, F32, F40, F43, F44, and F38."

The classifier outputs C3 as the most probable class label with a predicted likelihood of 63.95%, which is greater than the 18.38%, 6.65%, and 11.02% probabilities, respectively, across the alternative classes C4, C2, and C1. Analysis of the attributions of the variables showed that F24, F4, F14, F7, and F23 are the major contributors to the decision made here. Other variables with a level of influence on the decision include F26, F28, F22, F16, and F13. Among these influential variables, F4, F23, F7, and F13 are the subsets that positively contribute to the classification decision in favour of the assignment of C3. F24, F14, F26, F28, F22, and F16, on the other hand, are to blame for the classification decision's uncertainty because their negative contributions only sway the decision away from C3 and towards a different label. In fact, given that the majority of the variables of interest have negative contributions, it is not surprising that the confidence in the C3 label selection by the model is reduced to 63.95%."

Based on the predicted probabilities, there is little chance that any of the remaining labels is the right one. The confidence level associated with the decision to label the case as C4 is mainly due to the contributions of F15, F8, F4, F18, and F17. In addition, the variables F24, F13, F22, F1, F6, and F25 are shown to have moderate contributions. Regarding the direction of influence of the variables, F15, F18, F13, and F6 are the most negative ones, causing the reduction in the probability that C4 is indeed the true label. The negative variables stated in the preceeding statement, together with other negatives F9, F7, F21, F11, F12, and F10, support labelling the case as any of the alternative labels instead of C4. However, contradicting the negative variables and driving the decision higher towards C4 are the positive variables F8, F4, F17, F24, F22, and F1. In addition, F25, F3, F23, F20, and F14 also support classifying the given case as C4. Lastly, not all features are considered by the algorithm to arrive at the classification verdict for the given case, and these irrelevant variables are F19, F2, F16, and F5."

        "narration":"First of all, the classifier is very confident that C2 is not the true label for the case here and looking at the predicted likelihoods of the other labels C1 and C3, there is little chance that either of them is the true label. In fact, C4 is the label assigned to the case under consideration since its predicted probability equal to 80.75% is far higher than any of the other possible labels and this classification decision is based on the values of the input features. The attribution analysis indicates that F15, F8, F4, F18, and F17  are the major player resulting in the different predicted likelihoods across the classes. The other features or variables contributing perhaps moderately to the decision are F24, F13, F22, F1, F6, and F25. Critical look at the attribution map reveals that F20, F14, F19, F2, F16, and F5 have negligible or insignificant influence on the labelling decision and it can be said the model pays little attention to their values. Furthermore, pushing the decision higher towards C4 are the positive features mainly F15, F8, F4, F17, F24, and F22 together with other positives F1, F25, F23, F20, and F3. Finally, the doubt in the prediction decision here as represented by the likelihoods of C1, C3, and C2 is attributed to the negative contributions of F18, F13, F6, F9, F7, F12, F10, F21, and F11."

        "narration":"According to the ML algorithm or model used for this classification task, the probabilities that any of the possible labels C2, C3, and C1 is the true label are 63.07%, 20.60%, and 16.33%, respectively, indicating that C2 is the most likely label here. The reason for the high inclination towards labelling the case as C2 is the values of the features such as F8, F39, F27, F17, F21, F45, F22, and F35. However, a critical look at the degree of contribution of each input feature reveals that only the values of F37, F30, F4, F42, and F51 have negligible control over the final decision made by the model, and this is mainly because their attributions are equal to zero. There is a doubt in the classification output since the likelihoods of the other labels are not equal to zero, and this can be attributed to the fact that the features such as F27, F45, F22, F10, F2, F36, F31, and F5 have negative contributions. To the contrary, the decision to allocate a higher likelihood to C2 can be attributed to the positive contributions of features such as F8, F39, F17, F21, F35, F11, and F1, which decrease the odds of the labels C1 and C3 in favour of C2. All in all, since F27 is just the negative contribution among the top influential features, F8, F39, F27, and F17, it is not strange that the model decided to label the case as C2.",
        "narration2": "The following classification statements are based on the case information supplied to the prediction model. Class C1 has a prediction probability of 36.33%, whereas class C2 has a prediction value of 63.67%. As a result, it is correct to deduce that C2 is the most likely label for the given case."

Among these relevant features, only F7 and F5 have a negative contribution, decreasing the odds of #CA being the correct label for the given case. On the other hand, these features are shown to have a moderate contribution to the decision here since they contribute positively towards labelling the case as #CA. Besides, all the remaining features have positive attributions, improving the chances that #CA is the right label here. Finally, it is important to note that not all features support the assigned label; this could explain why the algorithm is very certain about the classification verdict above.

This is in contrast to the four negative features ( F7, F14, F10,and F5 ) which have a moderate effect and shift the prediction towards #CB. Finally, the least important feature is shown to be identified as \" F9 \" with a very low positive attribution.

In fact, analysis performed shows that F4, F7, F14, F10, F2, as well as F5 have negative attributions, pushing the labelling decision towards #CB instead of #CA.

On the other hand, F3, F12, F10, F2,, and F2 have negative contributions, suggesting that perhaps #CB could be the true label rather than #CA.

        "There is a split on which label is appropriate for this case. The model is unsure which of the two labels is right, but the classifier is fairly certain that #CA is the correct label. This decision is mainly based on the influence of F6, F8, and F1. Among these four, F6 is shown to have the most significant influence, leading to the prediction verdict above. On the other hand, there are a number of features with moderate-to-minimal influence. These include F7, F4, F5, F11, F12, F10 and F2. Finally, it is important to note that the value of F2 could be used to explain why the model has a 15.0% confidence level. However, the very high confidence in the above classification could be attributed to only the negative features' rather strong attributions towards the assignment of label #CB. Other features that shift the verdict away from #CA are F7 and F5.",

The abovementioned prediction verdict is mainly based on the influence of the following features or variables: F6, F8, F1, and F7. On the other hand, the values of F3 and F2 are less important in this labelling assignment decision. According to the attribution analysis, F9, F4, F5, F11, F12, F10, F2, etc. are the variables with a negative influence, shifting the prediction decision in the opposite direction. These negative variables support generating the alternative label, #CB. Finally, it can be concluded that there is a small chance that the true label could perhaps be #CA (with a greater degree of confidence). However, this is outweighed by the contributions from the remaining variables. From the analysis conducted to check out the attributions of each feature, ten of them are shown to be positive, explaining the very high confidence level.

The above classification decision is mainly based on the attribution of F6, F8, F1, and F8. All these features positively support the #CA prediction, whereas F3 and F3 are the top negative attributes, pulling the prediction in favour of #CB.

This might explain the degree of confidence associated with the prediction choice above. Finally, the analysis performed shows that only F7 and F4 are shown to contribute to minimising the chances of #CA, as indicated by its prediction probabilities across the classes.

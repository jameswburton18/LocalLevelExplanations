To be specific, the predicted likelihoods across the classes C1, C3, and C2, respectively are 40.36%, 49.49%, and  10.15%. The moderately high classification confidence could largely be due to the impact of certain input features supplied to the classifier. In fact the attribution analysis indicates that F14, F8, F15, and F28 are the most relevant features resulting in the predicted probabilities across the labels. Other features with moderate contributions include F2, F36, F30, F26, F3, F18, and F9.  Among these top influential features, F8, F28, F2, F36, F30, F3, and F18 have negative contributions that shift the decision in a different direction towards the other possible label. On the contrary, the top positive features encouraging the classifier to label the case as C3 are F14, F15, F9, F26, F35, and F33. Considering the attributions across the positive and negative features, it is not surprising that there is such predicted probabilities for the different classes."

Therefore, the prediction model outputs C3 as the most probable label since the other labels have lower likelihoods. The different variables have varying levels of influence on the decision made by the model with respect to the case under consideration. The top influential variables are shown to be F40, F14, F2, F36, F18, and F11. In addition, those with moderate influence or contributions are F41, F10, F3, F28, F30, and F4. Per the attribution analysis, the variables positively driving the conclusion towards C3 are F14, F2, F18, F11, F10, F28, F42, F13, and F26. However, the negative contributions of F40, F36, F41, F3, F4, F6, and F30 are the reasons why the model is not 100% certain about the C3 label assigned. These negative variables favour generating a different class as the true label instead of C3, however, the positive features succeed in steering the decision higher towards C3."

Favouring the assignment of a different label are the negative features such as F26, F17, F37, F12, F34, F25, and F18 which is the reason for the moderate predicted probabilities of C1 and C2. However, the positive contributions of features such as F3, F2, F35, F14, F21, F22, and F27 improve the probability of the C3 label which is further supported by other positive features F19, F40, and F15.\u00a0"

Consequently, we can safely say that C3 is the probable class label in this situation. With the exception of F10 and F17, all the input features contribute to the decision made by the classification model with regards to the case under investigation here. Based on the attributions, F5, F7, F6, F8, and F3 are marked as the positive features since their influence and contribution motivate the model to label the case as C3. However, decreasing the probability of the assigned C3 label are the negative features such as F13, F16, F15, F12, F4, F9, and F11. Actually, some of the negative features likely support labelling the case as C1, while some also suggest that perhaps C2 could be the true label. At the end of the day, the different contributions of the features are to be blamed for the abovementioned classification decision."

Furthermore, it revealed that while F7, F14, F1, F9, F4, F5, and F13 positively support and contribute to the assignment of C3, the contributions of the features F3, F8, F6, F2, and F10 drag the decision towards the other labels.

The model predicted the C4 class for the test case with a moderate degree of confidence.

Digging deeper revealed that F14 and F12 are irrelevant to the model's decision with respect to the case under consideration here. These two features aside, all the remaining features are shown to exert varying degrees of impact or influence, resulting in the predicted likelihoods across the possible classes. To be specific, whilst F8, F11, F10, F3, F2, and F16 increase the odds in favour of C4, negative features like F15, F4, F17, F1, F9, and F5 suggest that there is a possibility that C4 is not the true label. The contributions of the negative features are the reasons for the 37.43%, 5.23%, and 11.81% predicted likelihoods for the labels C1, C2, and C3, respectively. Finally, F18, F6, F7, and F13 are the remaining features, and they happen to have positive attributions, further motivating the model to assign C4 as the most probable label."

When the contributions of the variables were investigated, it was discovered that the values of F24, F8, and F11 have a very marginal (negligible) impact on the classification verdict here. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that F10, F14, F4, F17, F5, F20, and F13 are the positive variables that steer the prediction higher in favour of C4 and away from the other labels. However, the attributions of the positives are contradicted by the negative influences of variables such as F23, F1, F18, F16, F12, and F19. These variables, together with other negatives F22, F3, F6, F2, F21, F7, F9, and F15, shift the prediction away in the direction of the other labels, C2, C1, and C3."

The next likely label is C3, which has a probability of roughly 37.01%. The classifier, on the other hand, is positive that neither C1 nor C2 is the true label. Given how close the predicted probabilities of C4 and C3 are, the latter could easily pass as the true label for the case under consideration here. The aforementioned judgement is mostly based on the features of the given case and the classification decision is shown to be mainly influenced by the values of F10, F18, F14, F8, F2, F3, and F13. In addition, F15, F1, and F11 have moderate contributions to the decision here. However, F16, F19, and F9 are shown to have insignificant contribution to the decision, hence it is valid to conclude that the classifier likely ignored their respective values when it was picking between the four possible labels. The confidence level in the assigned label can be blamed on the top negative features F10, F14, and F18, which decrease the probability that the true label is C4. Together with other negative features, F8, F13, and F1 support the assignment of any one of the other labels, perhaps C3. In a nutshell, despite the strong negative attributions of F10 and F18, positive features such as F15, F6, F2, and F3 successfully push the decision higher in favour of C4."

The prediction assessment above is mainly based on the variables or attributes of the given case and in fact, an examination of the variables' contributions and influence suggests that F10, F5, and F7 are largely to blame for the decrease in certainty with regard to this C4 assignment. These negatives favour assigning a different label instead, and it is likely that they mostly favour one of the other probable labels, C2 and C3. Conversely, the values of F2, F8, F13, F11, F12, F6, F9, and F15 are the main reasons why the classifier is 55.04% certain that neither C1 nor C2 nor C3 is the true label. These variables are referred to as positive variables since their attributions push the classification toward the classifier's output decision.

Examination of the variable attributions indicated that the decision was reached with less emphasis on the values of F2 and F1. However, consideration was given to the values of F9, F6, F5, F3, F4, F8, F7, and F10. Among the influential variables, F5, F3, and F4 make up the positively supporting the assignment of C4. Contrarily, F9, F6, F8, F7, and F10 are considered negative variables since their contributions only decrease the probability that C4 is the true label, and from the predicted probabilities, it seems these negatives are somewhat successful in their ploy to shift the decision in a different direction."

Therefore, based on the predicted likelihood of the classes, C4 is generated as the most likely label. Furthermore, the chances of C2 and C1 are very low when compared to the chances of C3 and C4. The degree of confidence in the prediction decision made by the model can be attributed to the impact of the different input features. Examining the attributions of the features showed that F12 and F10 are not relevant to the model's decision and unlike these two features, the remaining features are shown to have either positive or negative contributions. The positive features that increase the probability of the C4 label are F16, F14, F15, F11, F7, F17, F4, F1, F8, and F5. Negative features such as F2, F6, F13, F3, and F9 lower or reduce the odds of C4, favouring the possibility of C3."

As a result, C4 is given as the most likely label based on the estimated likelihood of the classes. Furthermore, the possibilities of C1 and C2 are quite minimal when compared to C3 and C4. The influence of the various input variables on the model's prediction choice may be linked to the degree of confidence in the model's prediction decision. Assessing the feature attributions revealed that F12 and F10 are irrelevant to the model's judgement. The other variables, in contrast to these two, are proven to have either positive or negative contributions. F16, F11, F15, F14, F17, F7, F4, F1, F8, and F5 are positive variables that raise the likelihood of the C4 classification. F2, F6, F13, F3, and F9 are negative variables that lessen or diminish the likelihood of C4, increasing the chance of C3."

The aforementioned classification assertions are mostly attributable to the information provided to the model regarding the case under consideration here. The attribution examinations revealed that the prediction is mainly influenced by the values of F36, F2, F46, F12, and F50. Furthermore, the prediction is moderately motivated by the impact of F38, F47, F53, and F23. However, the analysis also showed that features such as F6, F28, F39, and F52 played very little role in the classification. While some of the influential features positively contribute to the prediction decision, the others have negative attributions that decrease the predictability of the C2 label. The features with negative contributions include F36, F2, F23, F53, F1, F44, F15, and F7, whilst the positive features include F46, F12, F50, F47, F38, F19, F41, and F5."

With moderate confidence, the model predicted the C3 class. In reality, the predicted probabilities of C1, C2, and C4 are all less than 37.64%, indicating that neither of these three labels is true, nor perhaps C1 could be likely since its predicted probability is 33.51%. From examining the attributions, we can rank the influence of the different features as: F5, F9, F2, F3, F6, F1, F8, F7, F4. Therefore, it can be concluded that the major driving factors regarding this prediction are the values of mainly F5, F9, F2, and F3, whereas F4's value received less consideration from the model. The features with positive contributions pushing the model higher towards the C3 label are F9, F2, F3, and F6. The negative features F5, F1, F8, and F7, on the other hand, contradict the influence of the positive features and steer the decision in a different direction.The contradiction of the positive contributions by the negative features explains why the model is not very certain that C3 is the right label. However, judging based on the predicted probabilities, the likelihood of C4 is very small, which appears to suggest  that the negative features support assigning one of the other labels, C2 and C1, as the true label."

Finally, the classifier is also certain that C3 is not the true label since it has the least predicted likelihood. The case labelling assessment above is mainly based on the values of the variables in the given case. Specifically, checking out the attributions of the variables showed that F28, F8, F29, F13, and F15 are the most relevant variables, whereas variables such as F30, F11, and F24 are somewhat ignored by the classifier when deciding which of the labels is the most likely. Pushing the prediction higher towards and in the direction of C1 are the variables with positive contributions, such as F28, F13, F20, F32, F34, F22, and F23. On the contrary, F8, F29, F15, F9, F6, F21, F17, and F31 are among the variables with negative attributions that shift the decision regarding the label for the given case in the direction of one of the other labels. When you consider the joint positive attribution to the joint negative contributions, it is not surprising that the confidence level in the classification is around 64.29%."

The prediction of the C3 label together with the predicted likelihoods with regard to the case under examination is mainly influenced by the values of F8, F7, F20, F22, F9, F21, F1, and F12. The other players with some level of influence on the decision include F3, F4, F23, and F14. The attribution analysis also indicated that there is a higher possibility that the values of the least ranked features, such as F18, F2, and F6, are not taken into consideration. Among the influential features, F8, F20, F22, F3, F14, and F17 are shown to contribute positively, which supports the assignment of C3 to the case given here. Conversely, F7, F9, F21, F12, F1, F4, F23, F13, F24, F11, F10, and F15 are negative features that steer the decision threshold to tilt in favour of one of the alternative labels."

According to the investigation, F4, F1, F8, F6, and F7 make up the positive features and are mainly responsible for pushing the verdict in favour of C4. Shifting the prediction verdict in a different direction, perhaps towards the C3 class or maybe C2, are the negative variables F10, F2, F5, F9, and F3.

Inspecting the contributions of the different variables showed that F3, F20, F23, and F33 are the major contribution factors resulting in this classification output. The moderately influential variables include F8, F10, F32, and F11. However, F28, F31, and F14 are marked as the irrelevant variables hence it can be concluded that the  algorithm likely ignored their values when deciding the best possible label with respect to the given case.  In addition, the investigation further revealed that while variables such as F20, F33, F10, F30, F19, F9, and F11 have positive attributions that drive the classification towards the C3 label, the contributions such as F3, F23, F8, and F32 support labelling the case as either of the remaining possible labels."

The degree of certainty in the above prediction can be attributed to both the magnitude and direction of impact of the different input features considered. Examination of the attributions indicates that the features, when ordered by their respective magnitude of impact, are as follows: F2, F5, F8, F3, F1, F7, F4, F6. This suggests that the major contributors to the prediction are F2, F5, and F8, while the least relevant ones are F7, F4, and F6, which are also shown to have negligible influence on the algorithm. In simple terms, little emphasis or consideration is given to the values of F7, F4, and F6 when deciding the true label for the given case. There are only two features shown to positively support the classification output and these are F1 and F8. On the contrary, F5, F2, and F3 have negative attributions that decrease the prediction probability of the C3 label. Actually, the negative features identified here have values that indicate that any one of the remaining labels could be the appropriate label for the given case."

The algorithm, on the other hand, is positive that C2 is the least probable class. When you consider the likelihood of the classes, the confidence in the classification is not as high as expected. Per the prediction algorithm, the values of F8, F1, F3, F4, F6, F9, F5, F2, and F7 are the main contributing factors leading to the class assignment here while the attribution of F10 is insignificant with respect to this classification. Looking at the attributions of F8, F1, F3, F9, F5, F2, and F7, it is not surprising that there is only a 39.68% chance that C1 is the true label, a 26.43% chance that C2 is the true label, and a 33.9% chance that C3 is the true label. However, the positive contributions of F4 and F6 steer the prediction moderately higher in the direction of C1, hence the prediction decision made here."

Examining the individual attributions of the variables indicates that the classification decision was made with little emphasis on the values of F17, F20, F12, F4, F6, and F23. This implies that all the remaining variables have some level of influence on the model's decision with respect to the given case. The influence of F1, F5, F7, F10, F21, and F24 supports the theory that a difference class could be the true label. However, the negative influence of these features is countered by the positive attributions of F3, F22, F14, F11, F13, F18, F16, F19, F8, F2, F9, and F15, resulting in the prediction verdict heading in the direction of C3."

However, it is important to note that there is only a 24.68% likelihood that C1 is the true label, and a 1.02% chance that C2 is the correct label.

The above prediction conclusions are mainly due to the influence of features such as F12, F11, F9, and F6. However, the algorithm paid little attention to the values of F2, F1, F16, and F10 hence are regarded as irrelevant to the prediction made with respect to the given case. For the relevant features, while some are regarded as negative features, other are shown to have positive attributions. The negative features reducing the likelihood of the C1 label are F12, F6, F4, F13, F7, F18, and F14 and as shown their influence on the algorithm resulted in the doubt in the classification as indicated by the predicted probabilities across the C3 and C2 labels. From the attribution analysis,  it is valid to conclude that the decision to label the case as C1 is due to the positive influence of F11, F9, F15, F17, F5, F8, and F3."

The predicted confidence level is attributed to the influence of certain input variables provided to the classifier, since the values of F13 and F12 are shown to have negligible influence on the classifier when it comes to the case under consideration. Decreasing the probability of C3 being the true label are the values of F8, F3, F15, F4, F16, and F11, since their attributions or contributions are driving the prediction in a different direction away from C3. Finally, the F19, F6, F1, F5, F14, F9, F10, F18, F7, F17, and F2 are the positive variables that make the verdict head in the direction of C3."

The attributions of F1, F2, F6, and F5 indicate that their influence on the classification is very marginal, hence it is valid to conclude that they are not relevant when it comes to labelling the case here.

The very marginal uncertainty in the label decision is attributed to the negative features F15, F7, F18, F6, F1, F10, F12, F5, and F11, since their respective contributions are shown to push or shift the verdict towards the alternative labels.

The narrative told by the attributions inspection is that the values of F5 and F15 have little to do with the output decision. However, the top features contributing to this label selection are F12, F14, F7, and F10. Moderately important features include F6, F1, F13, F16, F3, F18, F17, F8, F11, F2, and F9. The inspective conducted also revealed that the joint negative contribution of F12, F7, F4, F18, F17, F8, F11, F2, and F9 is to blame for the decrease in the certainty of the assigned label. The negative features mentioned above indicate or suggest that one of the alternative classes could be the true label. Contrastingly, the reason for assigning C2 is traced to the positive contributions of F14, F10, F6, F1, F16, F3, and F13."

Investigating further showed that the values of F8, F1, F9, F4, F3, and F2 contribute negatively to the prediction, resulting in a reduction in the likelihood of the C1 label.

For this decision, the variables with higher contributions are F13, F5, F16, F9, F6, F14, and F8, but on the other hand, those with the least significant influence are F15, F3, F1, F7, and F2.

Shifting the classification decision higher towards C3, on the other hand, are the positive variables F13, F5, F16, F6, F8, F10, F7, and F12. When comparing the magnitude of influence of the negative variables to that of the positive variables, it is very obvious why the classifier is highly certain that neither C4 nor C1 nor C2 is the right label here. This is because, among the top positive variables, F13, F5, F16, F6, and F8 have higher joint contributions than the most negative ones, F9, F14, F17, F11, and F4, therefore, the classifier is more motivated to label the case as C3 instead."

The factors with the greatest effect on this decision are F13, F5, F16, F9, F6, and F14, whereas those with the least significant influence are F15, F3, F1, F7, and F2. In terms of impact direction, the factors having negative influence, thus lowering the likelihood of C3 being the actual label, are F9, F14, F17, F11, F4, F15, F1, F3, and F2. Positive variables F13, F16, F6, F5, F12, F10, F7, and F8, on the other hand, shift the data classification choice higher towards C3. When the level of effect of the negative factors is compared to that of the positive variables, it is clear why the classifier is certain that neither C4 nor C1 nor C2 is the correct label here.This is because the top positive variables, F13, F5, F16, F6, and F8, have greater combined contributions than the top negative variables, F9, F14, F17, F11, and F4, so the classifier is more inclined to classify the instance as C3."

According to the predicted probabilities, the next likely class with a likelihood of 16.31% is C3, followed by C2 with 2.31% and finally C1 with a likelihood of 1.52%. This classification output decision is mainly based on the influence of the features F12, F15, F3, F14, and F16. F8, F10, F18, F6, F4, and F5 are some other features that have a moderate impact. In addition, the analysis conducted indicates that F13, F11, F2, and F7 are irrelevant to the classification decision with respect to the given case. Based on the direction of contributions of features, F12, F18, F9, and F17 are identified as the features with negative attributions that lend themselves to decreasing the odds of the output label. It can be concluded that the negative influence of these features is countered by the positive influence of features F15, F3, F14, F16, F8, F10, F6, F4, F5, and F1 that push the verdict higher and closer to C4."

The classification algorithm verdict here is mainly influenced by the values of F30, F35, F16, F1, F15, and F24, but on the contrary, the values of F26, F18, F6, and F23 are not relevant to the decision with respect to the case under consideration. Looking at the influential variables, the top positive ones shifting the decision higher towards the C2 label and away from the other labels are F30, F35, F16, F1, F13, F3, F33, and F10. Contradicting the positive variables are those reducing the odds of the assigned label, which are F15, F24, F34, F19, F22, F32, and F9. Comparing the extent of influence of the positive variables versus that of negative variables explains why the algorithm is certain that neither of the remaining labels C1, C4, and C3 is the appropriate label for the given case. To put it simply, the positive contributions of F30, F35, F16, and F1 outranked those of the top negative variables, F15, F24, F34, F19, and F22, hence the confidence level associated with the C2 label assigned to the case here."

Specifically, while the features F5, F6, F3, F8, F4, and F2 are shown to have contributed to the decision, F1 and F7 are deemed irrelevant by the model. For the relevant features, F6, F3, F2, and F4 contributions suggest that C1 is likely not the true label, which explains why the predicted probability of C1 is only 53.2%. Conversely, the motivation to label the given case as C1 is mainly due to the positive contributions of F5 and F8 pushing the classification higher away from the alternative labels, C3 and C2."

From the attribution investigation performed, the values of F3, F4, F7, and F9 have moderate contributions. The investigation also identified that the values of F1 and F11 are likely irrelevant, and hence have insignificant contribution to the algorithm's verdict with respect to the given case. Furthermore, while the values of F14, F2, F9, F17, and F10 are shown to positively improve the odds in favour of the C2 class, the values of features such as F8, F16, F13, F3, and F4 reduce the probability of the true label being C2. Together with other features F7, F12, F6, F5, and F15, the contributions of these negatives could explain why the predicted probability of C2 is only 61.39% while those of the remaining labels, C1 and C3, respectively, are 33.91% and 4.69%."

With a chance of around 16.31 percent, C3 is the next likely label. In contrast, the algorithm is certain that neither C2 nor C1 is the true label and the aforesaid prediction output decision is primarily dependent on the features presented to the classification algorithm. Conducting the attribution examination showed that the values of F13, F11, F2, and F7 have basically nothing to do with the decision to assign C4 to the given case. Conversely, the major contributors to the decision are the values of features such as F12, F15, F16, F3, and F14. The other notable contributors include F8, F10, F18, F6, and F4, whereas F5, F9, F17, and F1 are the least ranked among the influential features. Examining the feature attributions also indicated that the values of F12, F18, F9, and F17 can be blamed for the reduction in the odds of C4 being the true label since they contribute negatively contradicting the algorithm's choice. However, the push towards labelling the case as C4 is due to the positive contributions of features such as F15, F3, F14, F16, and F8."

The label choice is mainly due to the values of F20, F7, F24, F8, F2, and F33 since the attribution analysis identified them as the most influential variables considered by the algorithm. According to the attributions assessment, the variables responsible for the reduction in the probability of the C2 label include F20, F7, F8, F43, F30, and F1. The other negative variables include F21, F36, F37, F22, F38, and F28. What the negative variables suggest is that any of the labels, C1, C3, and C4, could likely be the true label. However, this push towards the alternative labels is contradicted by the positive variables such as F24, F2, F33, F32, F11, and F15, resulting in the C2 assignment. F29, F42, F5, F9, F19, and F12 are some of the remaining variables with positive attributions pushing the decision in favour of the C2 label."

From the attributions assessment, the features F20, F7, F8, F43, F30, F1, and F21 are marked as the negative variables since their contributions to the classification only lend themselves to pushing or steering the classification towards the alternative labels.

Together with other nagatives, F4, F11, F17, and F19, they support labelling the case with a different label.

Based on the predicted probabilities, it can be concluded that C1 and C2 have very little chance of being the true labels, whereas the likelihood of C3 is only 25.54%, making it the next probable label. The model's decision is heavily influenced by the values of F2, F7, F5, F18, and F11. But the values of F20, F21, and F17 are likely ignored by the model when deciding which label is most appropriate for the given case simply because they have attributions very close to zero. Pushing the model towards the alternative classes are the features F11, F9, F10, F8, F13, F16, and F19 with their negative contributions. In essence, the 63.11% confidence level in the decision is due to the strong positive influence of F2, F7, F5, and F18 while the remaining positive features are F3, F4, F6, F1, F15, F14, and F12."

The predicted probabilities of C1, C4, and C2, respectively, are equal to 9.35%, 20.79%, and 11.71%. By digging deeper, it is revealed that the features positively contributing to this classification are F4, F14, F6, F5, F2, F13, and F16. F11, F9, F10, F1, F18, F12, F17, F15, and F3, on the other hand, are the negative features that push the classification verdict in a different direction. These negatives favour or support labelling the case as one of the alternative possible labels explaining why the confidence level with respect to the decision here is moderate."

From the predicted likelihoods of the classes, C3 was chosen as the most likely one. Confidence in the algorithm's label choice is attributed to the varying degrees of input feature contributions. The feature attribution analysis performed indicates that the values of F6 and F3 are probably not taken into consideration in the decision making here. Conversely, the influential features can be ranked as follows: F12, F11, F2, F9, F8, F1, F13, F7, F5, F10, F4, F14. The predicted probability of C3 is only 64.26% due to the negative contributions of F8, F1, F7, F5, F4, and F14, since these features' attributions steer the verdict away from the C3 label. Positive features F12, F11, F2, F9, F13, and F10 push the prediction closer to the C3 label. On account of the fact that the top features F12, F11, F2, and F9 are all positive, it is not surprising that C3 has a fairly high predicted probability."

Specifically, the prediction probabilities of the other labels C2, C1, and C3, respectively, are 14.05%, 12.84%, and 15.11%. The major players resulting in this classification output decision are the variables F2, F19, F25, F38, F10, F3, F17, F8, F34, F15, F41, and F21. Among these top variables, F19, F38, F3, F34, F21, and F41 are the ones contributing negatively to the prediction decision. In other words, they are part of the variables pushing the verdict towards one of the other labels and away from C4. Those that enforce the predictive decision to head towards C4 are the variables F2, F25, F10, F17, F8, F15, and F42. Besides, given that F2 and F25 are positives and have the highest influence, it is not surprising that the model is sure that neither of the remaining labels is the right one."

Furthermore, the predicted likelihoods of the alternative classes C3, C1, and C2 are 3.67%, 2.21%, and 17.35%, respectively, which clearly signifies that the model is certain that the likelihood of any of these labels is much smaller than that of C4. Examining the input variables indicates that the variables playing significant roles in this classification decision are F45, F1, F13, F23, and F41. The other variables with moderate contributions are F20, F19, F32, F30, and F28. Finally, the examination concluded that the remaining features, such as F17, F12, F18, F8, and F15, have lower contributions to the decision. With respect to the direction of influence of all the variables mentioned above, F13, F41, F28, F16, and F8 are the ones with negative attributions, resulting in a decrease in the likelihood of the C4 label. Specifically, the negative variables support labelling the case as either of the other class labels, possibly C2. Contradicting the influence of the negative variables are the positive ones such as F45, F1, F23, and F20 that push the classification higher towards outputting the C4 label. In other words, the positive variables encourage the model to label the case as C4 instead of a different one."

It can be concluded that, given the likelihood of C3 and C2, the model is certain that none of them is the true label. Furthermore, the likelihood of C1 is far less than that of C4. Therefore, the classification output decision is that C4 is the most likely label, with a predicted probability of 69.11%. Motivating this classification decision are the variables such as F8, F16, F10, F6, F7, F5, and F15. Investigating the contributions of the input variables with respect to this classification showed that F8, F15, F13, F22, F29, and F14 are the top negatives, causing the uncertainty in the prediction. These negatives support assigning a different label to the case given while on the other side of the coin, the prediction is supported by the values of the top positive variables, F16, F10, F6, F7, F5, F11, F4, and F17. The positive variables are responsible for the model's being certain that the true label is likely C4."

This C4 predicted probability is far greater among the possible classes, hence we can conclude that the model is very certain that neither C1 nor C2 nor C3 is the true label. The features shown to play a major role in the class assignment decision above are F23, F44, F3, F39, F27, F45, and F13. Some of the other notable contributing features are F21, F16, F4, F37, F36, and F8. Among all the features mentioned here, F3, F27, F16, F4, F37, and F8 are the ones shown to have negative contributions, meaning they support assigning one of the other or alternative class labels. Contradicting the negative influence is the very high joint positive contributions of F23, F44, F39, F45, F13, and F21. Taking into account or consideration the contributions of the positive features, the model is highly motivated to label the case as C4 and they are the ones that push the decision away from the other labels."

Because the predicted probability for C4 is significantly bigger than the estimated probabilities for the other three labels, we can conclude that the model is extremely positive that neither C1 nor C2 nor C3 is the true label. F23, F39, F27, F44, F13, F45, and F3 are the variables demonstrated to have a significant impact on the class assignment choice above. F21, F16, F4, F37, F36, and F8 are some of the other major contributing variables. Among all the variables described above, F3, F27, F16, F4, F37, and F8 have negative contributions, indicating that they favour selecting one of the other alternative labels. The very large combined positive contributions of F23, F44, F39, F45, F13, and F21 contradict the negative influence. In closing, the model's decision to classify the instance as C4 is motivated by the positive variables, and these are the ones that drive the conclusion away from the other labels."

The certainty of the model can be traced to the influence of the information supplied about the case. Specifically, regarding this case under consideration, the model's decision concerning the right label choice is primarily affected by the values of F17, F44, F14, F37, F41, F20, and F22. And among these features, F37, F22, F20, and F41 are the top negative features that attempt to drive the classification towards one of the other labels. However, considering the certainty of the classification decision here, it can be concluded that the influence of these aforementioned negative features together with other negatives such as F33, F3, and F27 is very small when compared to that of the top positive features, F17, F44, F14, and F19.

With a confidence level of 81.28%, the algorithm outputs C4 as the most probable label choice. The influence of the various input variables analysed is responsible for the degree of certainty in the above prediction. Per the attribution examination, the most influential variables are F27, F8, F35, F20, F4, F24, and F29. Among the above-stated variables, F27, F4, F24, and F29 are the ones with positive attributions that drive the decision higher towards C4. Moderately influential positive variables are F46, F33, and F13. Given that the predicted confidence in the label choice is 81.28%, it can be concluded that the variables such as F8, F35, F20, F34, F39, and F49 with their negative attributions are responsible for the predicted likelihood across the alternative labels. In other words, the negative variables do not support labelling the case as C4, however, comparing the attributions of F8 and F35 to that of F27 explains why the algorithm is highly certain that C4 is the most probable label."

Finally, the likelihoods of C2 and C1 were 3.47% and 2.93%, respectively. Examining the attributions of the input variables indicates that F18, F22, F32, F7, F24, and F34 have the most influence on the classification output decision or verdict with respect to the given case. In addition, the values of F21, F3, F5, F33, F4, F46, and F38 are shown to moderately contribute to the decision made here. Among all the influential variables mentioned above, only F22, F24, F38, F4, and F46 are identified as negatives, suggesting that their contributions are responsible for the predicted likelihoods across the less probable labels C2, C1, and C3. In other words, the negative contributions of these variables support labelling the case as either of the alternative labels. Contrary to their negative influence, the values of F18, F32, F7, F34, F21, and F3 strongly motivate the classification decision to head towards C4 and away from the other labels. The negative and positive contributions of the variables explain why the certainty in the decision is only 70.19%."

Influencing the model's predicted outcome are mainly the variables F6, F20, F16, F3, F9, and F21. Those with moderate contributions are F19, F17, F18, F24, and F25. Examining further the attributions of all the above mentioned revealed that F6, F16, and F19 are the top positive variables, causing the model's decision to head towards label C4. When you consider the predicted probabilities across the labels, it can be concluded that the influence of top negative variables F20, F3, F9, F21, and F17 is responsible for the marginal doubt in the final decision since their values motivate labelling the case differently."

The algorithm's confidence in this classification is higher, mainly due to the positive and negative influences of the different variables. F6, F20, and F16 are the primary contributors to the above-mentioned classification output. The features that contribute positively to the decision are  F6, F16, and F19, and they are the features that shift the classification higher towards C4. On the flip side, negative features such as F20, F3, F21, and F9 reduce the likelihood of C4 being the true label, hence they support outputting one of the alternative labels."

F1, F31, F29, and F12 are by far the most influential, whereas F3, F32, and F17 are among the least influential. Regarding the direction of influence of the features, F31, F29, F12, F14, and F24 are the top positive features, shifting the classification decision higher towards C4. Conversely, the contributions of F1, F7, F16, F5, F27, and F15 indicate that the true label could likely be one of the other labels. The very high confidence level of 92.05% can be easily explained by considering the fact that the majority of top contributing features have positive contributions that strongly drive the decision away from the other labels and towards the C4 label. Finally, the attributions analysis indicates that the values of F18, F11, and F10 have insignificant contributions to the final decision."

The top positive features that increase the classifier's response in favour of C4 are F23, F3, F1, F20, and F16. Conversely, those with negative attributions that decrease the likelihood of C4 being the true label for the case under consideration are mainly F21, F4, F6, and F8, which are responsible for the apparent doubt in the classification output verdict. Given that several of the top influential features have positive attributions, it is not surprising that the output label of the classifier is C4 instead of another. Besides, F32, F12, F17, and F2 have moderate positive contributions, further shifting the decision towards C4. Finally, the classifier likely pays nearly no attention to the values of F10, F7, F26, and F22 since their attributions, according to the analysis, are almost zero."

In addition, the next probable label is C1, with a likelihood of 26.5%, which is followed by C2 with 11.38% predictability, and lastly, C3 with only 1.96% likelihood. Examining the feature attributions showed that F6, F1, F20, F22, and F5 are the main contributors to the classification decision made for the case here. Furthermore, the analysis categorised the features into three main groups based on their respective directions of contribution. The positive features are mainly F20, F22, F2, F14, F11, and F8 with contributions increasing the likelihood of the assigned label. Driving the classification in a different direction are the negative features such as F6, F1, F5, F24, and F9, since their contributions decrease the odds of C4 being the true label. Finally, the irrelevant set of features, F13, F12, and F21, whose values are likely ignored by the algorithm because their attribution scores are very close to zero, are the least ranked features. Given that the top features, F1 and F6, are all negative, it is not surprising that the algorithm is not 100.0% confident about the assigned label."

In addition, the likelihood of the assigned label is only 63.15%, and the features responsible for this decrease in the likelihood of C3 are the negative features such as F15, F9, F20, F37, and F5, since their contributions support a different label. F24, F10, F28, F13, and F16 are on the other hand, the top positive features that strongly drive the decision in favour of the C3 label."

In addition, the positive features are F13, F16, F8, and F15, further supporting the assignment of C3. On the contrary, shifting the prediction decision strongly in favour of one of the alternative labels is the top negative features, F4, F11, F6, F14, and F17. Finally, the attribution analysis also indicated that the values of F12 and F2 are irrelevant to the decision-making process with respect to this case."

The high positive attributions of F41, F39, F21, F32, and F34 improve the odds in favour of label C3, hence they push the classification decision away from the other labels. Swinging the decision in a different direction towards one of the other labels, C1, C4, and C4, are the negative features such as F14, F28, F5, F7, F9, and F43. These features, along with other negatives like F23, F16, and F12, explain why predicted probabilities of C1, C4, and C2 are greater than 0.0%. Finally, F3, F25, and F19 are also positive features, driving the decision further higher towards C3."

Inspection of the contributions of the variables indicated that the contributions of F16, F11, F9, F10, F17, and F5 are higher than all the other variables. Those with moderate contributions are F19, F20, F12, F7, and F25. Among all the above-mentioned variables, F16, F11, F12, F7, and F25 are the main positive ones, increasing the odds in favour of C3. Reducing the likelihood of the C3 label in favour of a different label are the contributions of F9, F10, F17, F5, F19, and F20, which explain the probability distribution across the alternative labels. Finally, the contributions of F29, F8, F3, and F1 are irrelevant to the algorithm's decision with regard to the given case since their attributions are very close to zero."

According to the direction of influence of the features, we can conclude that the strong positive influence of F20, F10, F16, F25, and F26 is far greater than the joint negative influence of F23, F15, F11, F14, and F21, which explains why the algorithm is relatively certain that neither C2 nor C4 nor C1 is the true label for the given case. Finally, the attribution analysis also showed that F3, F1, F5, and F29 have almost nothing to do with the decision made regarding this case under consideration."

The alternative labels, C2, C1, and C4, have their respective predicted likelihoods equal to 19.73%, 15.67%, and 1.18%. Considering the above-mentioned predicted likelihood, it is valid to conclude that the chances of C4 being the true label are very low compared to the others. The predicted likelihoods across classes are the result of the top variables F18, F6, F8, F14, F16, and F13's influences and contributions. The variables with moderate contributions are F10, F5, F2, F11, and F15, and finally, those identified as irrelevant to the decision are F3 and F4. Increasing the odds in favour of C3 are the positive contributions from F6, F8, F14, F16, F10, and F2, whereas, the contributions of F18, F13, F5, F11, and F15 contradict and support the assignment of an alternative label. In simple terms, the negative influence of the negative features is the main reason for doubt in the classification decision made by the model."

Among these top variables, the direction of influence of F20 and F41 suggests that they are negative variables, contradicting the decision made by the model and consequently reducing the probability of C3. Some of the other negative variables are F33, F16, F5, and F35. Countering the negative attributions and pushing the decision higher in favour of C3 are the positive variables F18, F31, F32, F40, F43, F44, and F38."

Analysis of the attributions of the variables showed that F24, F4, F14, F7, and F23 are the major contributors to the decision made here. Other variables with a level of influence on the decision include F26, F28, F22, F16, and F13. Among these influential variables, F4, F23, F7, and F13 are the subsets that positively contribute to the classification decision in favour of the assignment of C3. F24, F14, F26, F28, F22, and F16, on the other hand, are to blame for the classification decision's uncertainty because their negative contributions only sway the decision away from C3 and towards a different label. In fact, given that the majority of the variables of interest have negative contributions, it is not surprising that the confidence in the C3 label selection by the classifier is reduced to 63.95%."

Based on the predicted probabilities, there is little chance that any of the remaining labels is the right one. The confidence level associated with the decision to label the case as C4 is mainly due to the contributions of F15, F8, F4, F18, and F17. In addition, the variables F24, F13, F22, F1, F6, and F25 are shown to have moderate contributions. Regarding the direction of influence of the variables, F15, F18, F13, and F6 are the most negative ones, causing the reduction in the probability that C4 is indeed the true label. The negative variables stated in the preceeding statement, together with other negatives F9, F7, F21, F11, F12, and F10, support labelling the case as any of the alternative labels instead of C4. However, contradicting the negative variables and driving the decision higher towards C4 are the positive variables F8, F4, F17, F24, F22, and F1. In addition, F25, F3, F23, F20, and F14 also support classifying the given case as C4. Lastly, not all features are considered by the algorithm to arrive at the classification verdict for the given case, and these irrelevant variables are F19, F2, F16, and F5."

        "narration": "First of all, the classifier is very confident that C2 is not the true label for the case here and looking at the predicted likelihoods of the other labels C1 and C3, there is little chance that either of them is the true label. In fact, C4 is the label assigned to the case under consideration since its predicted probability equal to 80.75% whereas the next probable label, C3 is only 10.61% likely. This classification decision is based on the values of the input features and the attribution analysis indicates that F15, F8, F4, F18, and F17  are the major player resulting in the different predicted likelihoods across the classes. The other features contributing perhaps moderately to the decision are F24, F13, F22, F1, F6, and F25. Critical look at the attribution map reveals that F20, F14, F19, F2, F16, and F5 have negligible or insignificant influence on the labelling decision and it can be said the classifier pays little attention to their values. Furthermore, pushing the decision higher towards C4 are the positive features mainly F15, F8, F4, F17, F24, and F22 together with other positives F1, F25, F23, F20, and F3. Finally, the doubt in the prediction decision here as represented by the likelihoods of C1, C3, and C2 is attributed to the negative contributions of F18, F13, F6, F9, F7, F12, F10, F21, and F11."

The reason for the high inclination towards labelling the case as C2 is the values of the features such as F8, F39, F27, F17, F21, F45, F22, and F35. However, a critical look at the degree of contribution of each input feature reveals that only the values of F37, F30, F4, F42, and F51 have negligible control over the final decision made by the model, and this is mainly because their attributions are equal to zero. There is a doubt in the classification output since the likelihoods of the other labels are not equal to zero, and this is demonstrated or justified by the features such as F27, F45, F22, F10, F2, F36, F31, and F5 have negative contributions. To the contrary, the decision to allocate a higher likelihood to C2 can be attributed to the positive contributions of features such as F8, F39, F17, F21, F35, F11, and F1, which decrease the odds of the labels C1 and C3 in favour of C2. All in all, since F27 is just the negative contribution among the top influential features, F8, F39, F27, and F17, it is not strange that the model decided to label the case as C2."

Regarding the direction of influence of the features, F12, F33, F39, F5, F27, and F13 are the top positive features, increasing the probability that C2 is indeed the appropriate label for the given case.

The confidence level associated with the decision to label the data instance as C2 is mainly due to the contributions and influences of variables such as F20, F33, F7, F12, and F29. However, the classification algorithm did not take into account all of the input features when arriving at the abovementioned classification verdict since the features F16, F34, F30, and F24, are deemed irrelevant. Investigating the attributions further showed that those features with moderate contributions are F6, F3, F22, and F9. The strong push towards labelling the given case as C2 can be attributed to the influence of the top positive features F20, F33, F7, and F6. Other positive features further increasing the certainty of the C2 prediction are F22, F18, F25, and F5. The doubt in the classification decision as represented by the probabilities of the other classes C1 and C3 is mainly due to the negative influence of F29, F12, F3, F9, and F26. In conclusion, since the combined influence of the top positive features is very high, it is not very surprising to see that C2 is predicted with a confidence level equal to 82.96%."

F19, F33, F22, F24, and F25 are the features with the highest cumulative positive influence on the algorithm's decision to arrive at the abovementioned classification output verdict that C2 is the most probable label. The other positively supporting variables include F8, F32, F3, and F21. Since the likelihood of C2 is 71.38%, we can lay the blame for any uncertainty with regards to this classification on the negative variables such as F6, F13, F15, F9, and F4. This is mainly because the contributions of the above negatives together with F16, F26, and F28 reduce the odds of having C2 as the true label in favour of labelling the given case with a different label. It is also important to note that not all the input variables are seen as important in arriving at the classification decision with respect to the case under consideration, and these irrelevant variables are F35, F30, F23, and F10."

The class label in this case is projected to be C2 out of the three potential labels, with a likelihood of 55.86%, and the next likely label is C3, which has an approximate probability of 25.17%. The input features with values motivating the above classification output decision are mainly F14, F3, F7, F1, and F13, whilst those with the least influence on the decision are F6, F12, and F2. This implies that the features F15, F9, F10, and F11 are the ones with moderate influence on the predicted outcome for this case. Regarding the direction of influence of the features, F14, F3, F7, F13, F9, F11, F6, and F12 are the ones with positive contributions that push the model to generate C2 as the most probable label. On the contrary, the negative influence of F1, F15, F10, F8, F5, F4, and F2 shifts the decision in a different direction towards the other labels, in effect decreasing the probability that C2 is indeed the true label for the given case."

According to the classification model, C3 is the next most likely class, with an 11.25 percent chance of being the true label, while C1 has a 9.19 percent chance of being the true label. The features with the greatest impact on this decision are F1, F34, F7, and F28, which are followed by the moderate contributions of F13, F23, F3, F5, and F19. However, some of the features are shown to have negligible impact on the abovementioned classification output, and in fact, these are F10, F24, F36, and F31. Regarding the direction of impact of the input features, those with positive contributions driving the decision higher towards C2 are mainly F1, F7, F28, and F13. Decreasing the probability that C2 is actually the true label are the negative contributions of F34, F23, F5, F12, F9, and F4. All in all, since most influential features have positive contributions, this explains the predicted probability of the C2 compared to that of the other labels. Specifically, only F34 has a negative contribution, favouring the alternative labels among the major contributing features: F1, F34, F7, F28, and F13."

The classifier's decision to label the case as C2 is primarily influenced by the attributes F54, F73, F1, and F27, whereas there are only negligible contributions from F72, F55, F82, and F23. Shifting the classification lower in the direction of C2 are the main negative variables F54, F27, F46, F31, and F7, since their contributions indicate that the true label could perhaps be one of the next probable labels C1 and C3. On the contrary, the features firmly supporting the assignment of C2 to the given case are F1, F73, F12, F60, F75, and F65. In closing, the uncertainty in the output decision as represented by the predicted probabilities across the class labels can be attributed to the strong negative influence of the most influential features, F54 and F27."

The label selection is mainly due to the contributions of F4, F15, F34, F31, and F16, but conversely, the variables, F5, F25, and F6, are shown to have negligible contributions or influence on the model. The variables that are regarded as moderately important are F28, F35, F33, F12, and F20. Examining the attributions of all the relevant features indicated that the ones with negative impact or contribution resulting in a reduction in the likelihood of C4 being the true label for the case under consideration are mainly F4, F34, F33, F23, and F12. Positively driving the decision higher towards C4 and increasing its likelihood are the contributions of F16, F15, F35, F31, and F28. In closing, the certainty associated with the assigned label can be explained away by considering the fact that the joint positive influence of F16, F15, and F31 is higher than that of the top negative features, F4, F34, and F33."

The attribution analysis indicates that F11, F6, F9, F8, and F10 are primarily responsible for the assignment and classification decisions above. Other features with a moderate level of influence on the decision include F3, F15, F4, and F7, whilst the value of F2 is given very little weight when choosing the right label for the given case. The marginal uncertainty with respect to the label assignment for this case can be attributed to the negative contributions of F6, F8, F9, F15, F7, and F12 since they influence the decision to shift towards one of the least probable labels. Across all the input features, we can see that those increasing the probability that C4 is indeed the true label for this case are F11, F10, F3, F4, and F1."

The decision to label the case as C4 is mainly based on the values of F22, F11, F13, F2, F19, and F21, whereas the values of F6 and F12 are basically not relevant for the decision made. Regarding the direction of influence of the variables, those with the strongest positive contributions that increase the odds in favour of C4 are F22, F11, and F13. The remaining positive variables moderately pushing the decision higher towards C4 include \u00a0F21, F9, F17, and F15, whereas the least ranked positive variables are F7, F3, and F2. Covertly, the top negative variables F2, F19, F4, and F10 are driving the prediction away from the C4 label with their negative influence supported by the other notable negative variables F14, F5, F16, and F24. In closing, the fairly strong push towards labelling the case as C4 can be explained away by considering the fact that the top variables, F22, F13, and F11, all have positive contributions supporting the assignment of C4."

The classification decision for this case is mainly influenced by the values of F14, F16, F11, F23, and F34, while on the other hand, the values of F30, F39, F9, and F31 are identified as irrelevant to the final decision here. Among the influential variables, those with very high positive contributions in favour of the output label are F11, F14, F23, and F5. In contrast, F16, F43, F18, and F32 are shown to be the top negative variables, shifting the decision away from C4 in favour of the other labels. The variables with moderate positive influence include F47, F46, F52, and F13, whereas the moderately negative ones include F48, F17, and F20. Looking at the ranking of the variables based on their contributions, it is not surprising that the decision is to label the case as C4, but the contributions of F16 and F43 explain the little doubt about the correctness of the assigned label."

The variables with the most say in the abovementioned classification verdict are F49, F51, F52, and F48 but on the contrary, those with negligible or irrelevant contributions to the case under consideration here include F24, F1, F46, and F5. By virtue of the fact that the respective attributions of F24, F1, F46, and F5 are very close to zero when determining the correct label for the given case, it is valid to assert that not all the features have either positive or negative contributions. The marginal uncertainty in the decision made here could be attributed to the influence of negative variables such as F43, F60, F19, F59, and F13. The abovementioned negative variables together with F20, F7, and F27 support labelling the case as one of the other labels instead of C2. Overall, the very high confidence level in the prediction decision can be explained by comparing the joint positive influence of F49, F51, F52, F23, F48, and F47 to that of all the previously mentioned negative variables."

The variables with the most significant contributions are F19, F35, F40, F15, F27, and F17, however, the algorithm did not take into consideration all of the input features when arriving at the abovementioned classification verdict given that the variables F14, F3, F12, and F23, are deemed irrelevant according to the attribution analysis. Increasing the probability that C4 is indeed the true label are the top positive variables, F35, F40, F15, F1, and F36. Conversely, the negative variables such as F19, F27, F17, F38, and F25 have contributions or influences that shift the decision away from C4, casting doubt on the correctness of the prediction outcome. Other negative variables contributing to the decrease in the likelihood of C4 include F10, F29, F9, and F13, whereas the other positive variables increasing the odds of C4 include F37, F4, F26, F24, and F5. In essence, the high confidence in the assigned label can be attributed to the influence of positive variables such as F35, F15, and F40, which are shown to contradict the negative influences of F19, F27, and F17."

However, when arriving at the class assigned for the given case, the model is shown to not take into consideration all of the input features, that is F19, F1, F20, and F14 are regarded as irrelevant. Positively motivating the model to output the C3 label are the variables such as F5, F18, F21, F4, F11, and F15, while on the other hand, F10, F7, F3, F16, and F2 indicate that perhaps there is a chance that C3 is not the true label. The very small doubt in the decision as represented by the predicted probability of C1 can be blamed on the negative variables mentioned above. In closing, since there are more variables with a strong positive influence on the decision, it is not surprising that the confidence level is that high."

The classifier outputs C2 as the most probable class label with a predicted probability of 49.46%, which is higher than all the other classes, C1 and C3, with their likelihoods equal to 37.23% and 13.31%, respectively. F28, F12, F39, F35, and F1 are the relevant variables playing a major role in this classification outcome. However, the attribution analysis also revealed that F22, F4, F10, F21, and F6 can be considered irrelevant to the decision since their attributions or impacts are negligible. F23, F43, F26, and F37 are some of the variables with a moderate impact on the classification decision. It is concerning that the difference between the likelihood of C2 and C1 is smaller than expected and that the variables contributing to the doubt in the assigned label include F28, F12, F39, F23, F43, and F26. On the contrary, those increasing the belief in the correctness of C2 are the positive variables such as F1, F35, F37, F25, and F32. In essence, since the top variables, F28, F12, and F39, all have negative contributions, it is not surprising to have such probabilities associated with the other classes, C1 and C3."

However, looking at the predicted probabilities across the other plausible labels, it is clear why the classifier is very certain that none of them is the right one, and they are have the least  predicted confidence. The classification decision with regard to the given case is mainly influenced by the values of F73, F33, F24, and F70. But checking out the attributions of the variables showed that F17, F9, F22, and F38 have negligible influence on the classification decision with respect to the case under consideration here. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that F40, F8, F53, F10, and F14 are largely responsible for the predicted likelihoods across the alternative labels since their contributions only sway the decision away from C4 and towards a different label. Other negative variables, F67, F7, F5, and F2, are also responsible for the marginal uncertainty associated with the prediction of C4. Conversely, the contributions of F73, F33, F24, F23, and F70 increase the probability that C4 is indeed the true label for this case, and this decision towards C4 is further supported by F39, F44, F15, and F46."

It is important to note, however, that there is a 13.42% possibility of it being C1, a 0.68% chance that C3 is the true label, and a 4.92% chance that it is rather C2. The attribution analysis shows that F13, F4, F11, and F1 are the top variables, resulting in the predicted likelihoods across the classes. The other variables with moderate contributions are F7, F8, F12, and F14, whereas the least ranked variables are F2, F9, and F16. The analysis also revealed that the variables with negative contributions to the prediction include F1, F7, F8, F10, and F12, hence reducing the likelihood of the assigned label. On the other hand, the variables with positive contributions to the decision are primarily F13, F4, F11, F14, F6, and F5. In closing, the fairly high confidence level in the decision is as a result of the fact that the top variables, F13, F4, and F11, all have a positive impact on the decision."

F7, F17, and F3 are the major contributors to the above mentioned classification output, but the values of F4, F16, F1, F14, and F13 have negligible influence on the decision made here. In terms of the direction of the contributions of the influential features, the positive ones increasing the prediction likelihood of the C4 label are mainly F3, F11, F6, and F2. Contradicting the decision in favour of the other labels are the negative features such as F7, F17, F19, and F18 since they are shifting the decision away from C4. Moderately improving the validity of label C4 are the other positive features, F9, F15, and F12, whereas F10, F5, and F8 are the remaining negative features. To summarize, the strong negative impact of F7 and F17 explains why the confidence level with respect to this label assignment is reduced to just 63.17% as opposed to having a much higher certainty."

Therefore, we can conclude that the certainty in the C3 assignment is lower than expected and that the very strong negative influence of F18 can be blamed for that. Further shifting the decision away from C3 are the remaining negative variables, F2, F10, F3, F15, F19, and F9. The positive influences of F17, F6, F13, F7, and F16 are the ones driving the decision higher towards the C3 label. F12, F5, and F11 are the remaining positively influential variables, further improving the odds in favour of C3. Finally, the value of F1 is shown to have a negligible contribution to the decision since its attribution is closer to zero than any of the input variables."

F31, F32, F18, and F39 are the features with the most influence on the predicted probabilities across the three classes, while those with moderate influence are F34, F35, F25, F29, and F45. When it comes to assigning a label to this case, the algorithm paid little attention to the respective values of F8, F44, F38, and F47, which are regarded as irrelevant to their respective contributions. Examining the attribution analysis revealed that the variables increasing the probability that C3 is not the true label are the negative variables such as F31, F29, F28, F42, F16, and F20. On the contrary, the positive contributions from F18, F32, F39, F34, F35, and F25 motivate the assignment of the C3 label for the case under consideration. The other variables increasing the probability that C3 is the true label include F27, F45, F1, and F22, whereas those moderately decreasing the odds of C3 include F4, F46, F11, and F49. The contributions of the negative and positive variables explain why the algorithm is not 100.0% certain about the labelling verdict here, but 76.0% is a good confidence level."

The classification outcome is largely based on the values of F4, F14, F12, and F6, whereas the values of F9, F11, F2, and F13 are deemed irrelevant since their attributions are equal to zero. Regarding the direction of influence of the input features, those with negative contributions driving the classification away from the label C3 are F6, F1, F3, F10, and F5. Conversely, the values of F14, F4, F12, F8, F15, and F7 are the positive features that strongly support labelling the case as C3. When you consider the direction of influence of the top influential features, it is obvious why C3 is the preferred label for the case here."

The values of the variables F14, F1, F3, F21, and F15 are the primary contributors to the classification decision. On the other hand, the values of F17, F8, and F22 received very little consideration from the classifier when assigning the label for this case, as indicated by the magnitude of their attributions. Regarding the direction of influence of the variables, the strong positive variables that increase the likelihood of C3 are F14, F1, F21, F15, and F26. Conversely, the variables with a negative impact on the classifier are mainly F3, F13, F19, F2, and F16. Other positively contributing variables include F23, F10, F4, and F18, while the other negative variables are F24, F12, F7, F25, and F6. All in all, by just considering the attributions of the top influential variables, F14, F1, F21, and F15, it is less surprising that the classification decision is strongly towards C3 and away from the alternative labels, C2, C1, and C4."

The label assignment for the case under consideration here is largely based on the values of F18, F27, F13, F31, and F7, whereas the values of F17, F35, F8, and F10 are not taken into consideration since their attributions indicate that they have insignificant influence on the classifier. Strongly increasing the probability that C3 is actually the true label are the positive variables F18, F27, F13, F7, and F2. On the contrary, the negative variables driving the classification decision towards the alternative labels are mainly F31, F16, F29, F5, F22, and F26. The other positive variables further increasing the certainty of the classification decision are F3, F28, F11, F34, and F24. With most of the top variables having a positive impact on the classifier, it explains why the classifier is certain that none of the alternative labels is the true label for the case under consideration."

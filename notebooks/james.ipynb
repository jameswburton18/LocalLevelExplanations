To be specific, the predicted likelihoods across the classes C1, C3, and C2, respectively are 40.36%, 49.49%, and  10.15%. The moderately high classification confidence could largely be due to the impact of certain input features supplied to the classifier. In fact the attribution analysis indicates that F14, F8, F15, and F28 are the most relevant features resulting in the predicted probabilities across the labels. Other features with moderate contributions include F2, F36, F30, F26, F3, F18, and F9.  Among these top influential features, F8, F28, F2, F36, F30, F3, and F18 have negative contributions that shift the decision in a different direction towards the other possible label. On the contrary, the top positive features encouraging the classifier to label the case as C3 are F14, F15, F9, F26, F35, and F33. Considering the attributions across the positive and negative features, it is not surprising that there is such predicted probabilities for the different classes.'}"

       "[\"The prediction probability associated with class C2 and class C1, respectively, is 35.34% and 64.66%. Based on these probabilities, the model labels the given case as C1 since it is the most probable class. According to the attribution analysis, the most relevant features considered by the model here are F5, F1, and F8, while the least relevant features are F12, F2, and F4. Regarding the direction of influence of the features, F5, F1, F8, and F7 are the top positively supporting features, driving the decision higher in favour of C1. Further increasing the probability that C1 is the true label are the values of other positive features such as F16, F3, F15, and F14. To explain why the likelihood of C2 is 35.34%, we have to look at the negative contributions from F11, F6, F13, F2, F12, and F4. The abovementioned negative features contradict the model's decision with respect to the classification outcome.\",\n",
       " \"The classifier is very uncertain about the correct label for the case given.  Regarding the classifier's decision, there is close to an even split on the probability of either of the possible labels is the correct label but the classifier chooses the label as C2. The prediction verdict above is attributed to the contributions of mainly the following features: F4, F11, F3, and F15, however, the lowest ranked features are F7, F19, and F1. Analysing the direction of influence of the features shows that there are ten positive and ten negative features.  Positive features such as F3, F15, F8, and F20 increase the response of the classifier in favour of the assigned label. Conversely, negative features such as F4, F11, F12, and F2 decrease the likelihood of C2 being the correct label given that their values support the alternative label, C1. The uncertainty concerning the label assignment can be due to the fact that the top negative features F4 and F11 have very high attributions shifting the classifier's verdict away from the C2 class.\",\n",
       " 'The classification algorithm believes that C2 is the output label that was generated with 100% certainty and that C1 is unlikely to be the correct label in this case. According to the attribution investigations, the following input features are ranked from most relevant to least relevant: F2, F4, F6, F1, F3, and F5. As shown by the attribution plot, F2 is the only one shown to positively contribute to the above classification decision, while the others contribute negatively.

The model's confidence in the preceding prediction is around 96.35 percent, however, it is vital to remember that there is a very small probability of about 3.65 percent that the right label is C2. The following is an ordering of the input features based on their individual contributions to the aforesaid classification decision: F2, F18, and F19 are the three most important features. Following these variables are F11, F14, F8, F4, F7, F16, F13, F20, F9, F17, F12, F6, and F5 with moderate contributions whereas the values of F10, F1, F3, and F15 have little influence on the prediction of C1. The evaluation assessments below only take into account the variables that have been found to have the most significant influence on the prediction's direction. Among the most influential variables, only F11 and F14 have a negative influence, but the others, F8, F18, F2, and F19, have been shown to make positive contributions to the model's prediction for the case. Therefore, it is not surprising that the label given is C1, with such a higher level of certainty, when considering the cumulative impacts of each pair of positive and negative traits.\",\n",
       " 'The probability of having C1 as a label is only 7.0%, therefore, the most probable class for the given case is C2. The primary drivers decreasing the odds of C2 for the above classification output are the values of the features F2, F6, F4, and F5 with negative contributions. Conversely, the positive contributions of F11, F9, F1, and F3 drive the model towards generating the label C2. In conclusion, the most relevant feature is F11, while F7, and F10 are not as relevant as F11 for the above labelling task.',\n",
       " 'The probability of the label being C2 in this case is 72.83% while there is a 27.07% chance that C1 is the correct class. Among the features, the two most influential are F4 and F3. The remaining features, arranged by the magnitude of their respective influence, are F9, F8, F5, F1, F2, F7, and F6. Of all the input features, only F3, F9, and F8 have implicit values for the estimation of C1. The remainder are termed positive features given that their values motivate the estimation of the C2 class and  their cumulative effect is higher than negative ones.',\n",
       " 'The label assignment here is based on the information supplied to the classifier and the predicted probability of C2 is 48.40% whereas that of C1 is 51.60%. Hence C1 is chosen as the most probable label over C2, however, it is concerning that the classifier is not certain about this verdict given that the difference between the two probabilities is very small. The uncertainty in the classification decision can be attributed to the influence of negative features such as F21, F26, F32, and F18. The contributions of the aforementioned negative features decrease the likelihood of the true label being equal to C1 since they support generating the alternative label, C2 as the likely one and the remaining negative features are F2, F15, F6, F28, and F22. Increasing the prediction probability towards C1 are the positive features such as F8, F11, F14, F13, F30, and F3 which are further supported by the remaining positive features F25, F20, F31, F24, and F33. Aside from all the above-mentioned features, all the remaining features including F27, F19, F12, and F29 have close to zero attributions since their values are somewhat irrelevant to the labelling assignment for the case given here.',\n",

The contributions of the input features can be ranked as follows: the most powerful set of features is F2, F5, F8, F7, and F10,  the effects of F9, F4, and F11 are moderate, and The F1, F12, F6, and F3 have little or no effect on the prediction above. As expected, given the strong positive contributions of F2, F5, F8, F7, and F10, the prediction decision is C2. Of the features that contributed moderately to predicting this condition, only F9 had a positive effect. The others, F4 and F11, are shifting the classification verdict toward C1, contradicting the assigned label.

The values of the input features have an impact on the classification above and the classifier ranks the features based on the strength of impact as follows: F1, F3, F4, F7, F2, F6, F5, indicating that F1 is the most significant feature and F5 is the least essential. To summarise, the high level of confidence in the classification may be due to the fact that only F3 and F2 are demonstrated to have negative contributions to the choice, and the combined effect of the negative features is low when compared to F1, F4, and F7.',\n",

The least relevant variables are F9, F14, and F13 judged based on the degree of their respective contributions. Among the input variables, only F11, F12, and F9 have negative contributions that favour assigning the label C1 instead of C2. However, looking the output prediction probabilities across the classes, we can conclude that the positive contributions from variables such as F2, F1, F7, and F3 outweigh the influence of F11, F12, and F9, hence the confidence in the decision above.',\n",

In terms of the contributions from the different features, the most important features for this classification decision include F44, F8, F3, and F27. While the values of F44 and F3 are pushing the prediction decision in the direction of the alternative class, F8 and F27, on the other hand, have strong positive support for the label assigned by the model. Other features that positively support the model's prediction are F10, F40, F46, and F28. In contrast, the F33 and F37 have a moderately negative influence on the model, shifting the final decision towards the class label C2.

On the other hand, negative influences such as F10, F17, F18, F9, and F7 are shifting the prediction in the opposite direction  but the combined effect of the above negative features on the model in this case is weaker than that of F22, F19, and F13.

Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the features have different directions of contribution to the prediction made by the model for the given case. The features with positive contributions that motivate the model to output C2 are F5, F3, F7, and F10.

Furthermore, F3 and F7 had identical levels of influence on predicting C2, with F3 having a slightly stronger effect. While F3 contributed positively to the prediction of C2, there is a negative contribution from F7 supporting the assignment of the least probable class, C1. The least essential variables, F2 and F6, have very little effect on the model and all of them have negative contributions that move the prediction decision or verdict away from C2. The analysis shows that only the variables F7, F6, and F2 have negative attributions, distorting the assignment of C2 or decreasing the odds of the C2 label. However, the mean attribution of F2, F6, and F7 is very low compared to the positive features, so the model relies heavily on the positive features, resulting in the selection of C2 as the most probable class and also the predicted probability of label C1.',\n",
